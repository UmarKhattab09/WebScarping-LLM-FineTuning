# WebScarping-LLM-FineTuning

- Scrapped a website with BeautifulSoup
- used Illama LLM to predict the categories of the news.


### Update
- Created a proper structure
- Live on huggingface https://huggingface.co/spaces/UmarKhattab09/WebScraping_With_LLM_FineTuning
- The only problem is the training, its trained on a very small dataset.Training takes a lot of time,
- Added Weights to the dataset so now if you press load the dataframe with impact. It will show a different pyVis Graph
