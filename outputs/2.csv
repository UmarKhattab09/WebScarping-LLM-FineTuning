0,politics,"President Trump meets with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Oval Office at the White House on July 22. During a question-and-answer session with reporters while at the meeting, Trump railed against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption The Justice Department on Tuesday said it is in touch with an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , to try to arrange a meeting with her in the coming days. President Trump said he thought the development ""sounds appropriate,"" though he also claimed to know nothing about it. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the plan on social media, saying that the department is seeking any information from Maxwell — who is serving time for sex trafficking — as part of its quest to uncover ""all credible evidence"" in the Epstein case. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, is facing a backlash from supporters who want more information released about the disgraced financier's crimes and his 2019 death by suicide in prison. Trump has dismissed the uproar as a politically driven ""witch hunt"" distracting from his agenda. Asked about the newest development on Tuesday, he told reporters, ""I don't really follow that too much."" His comments to reporters came while he was meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines on trade issues. After the meeting, Trump announced on social media that importers of goods from the Philippines will face a 19% tariff , while U.S. exports to the country will face no tariffs. Trump spent most of his time in the Oval Office question-and-answer session railing against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, recently published materials that she claims show that Obama officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ""It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. So you ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,"" Trump told reporters — the ""nonsense"" referring to the Epstein controversy. Trump said it was ""time to go after people"" in connection to his allegations about the 2016 election. Obama's office issued a rare response, calling Trump's statements ""outrageous"" and noting that conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election had been widely accepted. ""These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in the statement. Republicans in Congress have also been grappling with the Epstein issue. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced Tuesday that the House would finish work a day early, canceling votes scheduled for later in the week. That means members will leave town for an annual August recess without a fresh confrontation over Epstein. The schedule change was announced after repeated clashes among Republicans about the files, including a deadlock in the powerful House Rules Committee over an effort by Democrats to force additional votes on the Epstein matter. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales contributed to this report."
1,politics,"There is an ongoing staffing crunch at the Social Security Administration. Here is one of the agency's field offices, on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption The Social Security Administration (SSA) recently reassigned a small share of its field office employees in an effort to bring down lengthy wait times for the agency's national 800 phone number. Workers at local offices across the country say these reassignments have been disruptive for staff and are increasing wait times for other services. Experts say the tradeoff is a byproduct of a declining Social Security workforce dealing with thousands more Americans who qualify for benefits every day. Thousands of employees have left the government agency in recent months. ""They are in a deep hole of their own creation on staffing and so you just don't have enough people to go around to serve the public,"" said Kathleen Romig, a former SSA official who's now director of Social Security and disability policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). ""And so all you can really do at this point is rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic."" Earlier this month, about 4% of front-line workers were temporarily reassigned to cover the national 800 number, according to the SSA, which added that phone service has improved as a result. ""Thanks to a new telephone platform, most callers are now served quickly through callbacks or automated options, and answer times have already improved significantly in field offices,"" the agency said in a statement to NPR. ""By temporarily assigning a small percentage of field office staff to assist with 800 number calls, we can improve the 800 [number] average speed of answer without disrupting local services."" But Nicole Morio, a field office worker in Staten Island and union representative, said these reassignments have forced front-line staff to take on more work. ""The stress level is probably at a maximum for everyone,"" Morio said. ""At one point I think we were doing the work of 1.8 people. Now it seems as though we're doing the work of 10 to 15."" Monique Buchanan, president of an American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) chapter that represents teleservice center workers, told NPR that the agency has also started to reassign vital claims specialists to the 800 number. Buchanan, who works at a field office in Detroit, said temporarily removing claims specialists from front-line positions is ""directly harmful to the public."" She said these workers finalize applications for people seeking help accessing benefits, such as payments for disabled children. ""These applications are taken through an interview that the claim specialist engages in,"" she said. ""So, the start is the interview with the claims specialist."" CBPP's Romig said staffing up the national hotline might not actually be faster for beneficiaries because so much work is done by claim specialists and other staff at field offices. ""Often customers can't actually complete their business on the phone,"" she said. ""They are going to have to end up in a field office ultimately anyway, or a field office employee is going to have to process that claim that has been taken on the phone or resolve the problem that has been raised on the phone."" The agency recently touted that it had reduced the average answering speed on the 800 number to ""13 minutes, a 35 percent reduction compared to this time last year and over a 50 percent reduction compared to last year's annual average."" But experts say it's harder to track whether the agency is doing better in other metrics. Recently the agency took down various real-time metrics from its website. Romig said it's possible wait times are decreasing as more people are transferred to 800-number duty, but it will surely come at the expense of other vital services. ""Sure, you can get a boost in a particular metric like phone hold times by making a massive shift of staffers to answer the phones,"" she said. ""But you do that by creating a new hole in the field offices, and that's what they're doing."" A Social Security Administration office on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption Morio, the Staten Island employee, believes she and other field office workers are being ""prevented"" from properly serving the people who need their help. ""We can't complete all of the things that need to be done,"" she said. ""When you have so little employees and so much work — it's stressful because we get hired to help the claimants. We get hired to help the American public. We're public servants. That's what we do."" Policy experts and front-line workers say that lowering wait times for phone services is a worthy goal, but it cannot be achieved without hiring more staff. Romig said staffing levels at Social Security were already at a decades-long low before the Trump administration began urging people to resign or retire early. According to agency officials, roughly 4,600 employees have left since March. Romig cautioned that staffing ""numbers are very hard to pin down"" because resignations are constantly ""in flux,"" due to the administration's deferred resignation program and ongoing early retirements. During a congressional hearing last month, new SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano told members he does not believe increasing staffing is necessary to improve the agency's services. ""I do agree we must perform significantly better,"" he said, ""but increased staffing is not the long-term solution."" But Jessica LaPointe, who works at a field office in Madison, Wis., and is the president of the local AFGE chapter that represents 25,000 field office workers, said the shuffling of staffing is prompting even more people to leave the agency. ""If they decided not to take the buyout incentives that were offered in March, then now they're just leaving to save their mental health as their work keeps piling up,"" LaPointe said. ""It really is a manufactured crisis as a result of past changes that just continue to just make everything worse, sadly."" Some local field offices only have a few employees, so the loss of one can have a big impact. Juan Daniel Vasquez, who is a generalist technical expert in a field office in Monroe, Mich., said his office had an employee who covered the phones who was recently shifted to the 800 number. He said that since then, all the staff have been tasked with covering the phones, which has added a significant amount of work to everyone's plate. ""It's a lot tougher,"" Vasquez said. ""I'm nearing retirement age and … if you had asked me last year, I would have said I want to stay another five to seven years. Now I'm looking at one to two."" The agency told NPR that Bisignano has been ""visiting field offices and processing centers to hear directly from front-line employees,"" since his confirmation hearing. ""He is committed to giving SSA employees the tools they need to provide best-in-class customer service to the American public and succeed in their roles,"" the agency said in a statement. ""SSA monitors all workload measures in the field offices that are helping answer the 800 Number calls. In addition, we have established field office support units to assist with critical workloads and demands."" But LaPointe said that working conditions for field office workers in the past few months have only gotten worse. ""There's no indication that this is getting better,"" she said. ""We have an agency not listening to the workers."""
2,science,"Newborn babies lie in bassinets in the nursery of a postpartum recovery center in upstate New York in 2017. A new study examined births over decades to find tendencies toward having all girls or all boys. Seth Wenig/AP hide caption Couples who've been surprised by a string of baby boys or baby girls could be forgiven for wondering whether the odds in the offspring lottery are more than just pure chance. A new study by Harvard University researchers that examines the birthing records of 58,007 women suggests their hunch might be correct. The authors of the study, published in the journal Science Advances last week , found that instead of straight 50/50 odds between boys and girls with each birth, the offspring in families with at least three children tend to follow what scientists call a ""weighted coin toss,"" indicating that each family may have a distinct tendency toward girls or boys. ""We're seeing a lot of us having only boys or girls,"" says Siwen Wang, a doctoral student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the lead author in the study. That led her and colleagues to wonder ""whether it's simply by chance, or is there any underlying biology explaining these sex clustering within families?"" They analyzed data from the second and third iteration of the Nurses' Health Study , which tracked just over 146,000 pregnancies across the U.S. from 1956 to 2015. They found that if the first two children born in a family are girls, the chances of the third child also being a girl are higher than for a boy — and this pattern continues with subsequent children. The same holds true if the first two are boys: The likelihood of having another boy increases, and the trend persists through later births. ""Notably, in families with three boys (MMM), the probability of having another boy was 61%; in families with three girls (FFF), the probability of having another girl was 58%,"" the study authors wrote. Looking for a possible explanation, ""one of the things that stands out is age at first birth — that's associated with a moderately higher chance of having only boys or girls,"" Wang says. ""If you're starting your family younger than 23 ... [there is] around a 40% chance of having a same-sex family,"" she says. If the woman begins having children after age 28, it's around 50% — a relatively small but statistically significant difference. The researchers excluded families with only one child and pregnancies ending in miscarriage, stillbirth or twins. Women with a history of infertility treatments were also left out of the study. To avoid bias from parents who stopped having children after reaching a preferred sex ratio, the researchers did not count each woman's final birth in the analysis. The researchers speculate that in older women, shorter menstrual cycles could factor into the results and that changes in vaginal acidity might favor the survival of sperm carrying either the Y (boys) or X (girls) chromosome. However, they note that because maternal and paternal ages are often correlated, the father's age might also play a role. Since the study included only women, the authors emphasize that the exact mechanism remains uncertain. ""We don't have data about the dad,"" Wang says. ""We don't have data about his genetics or even very precise characteristics ... which is obviously important for sex determination."" It's a concern also raised by Mark Gerstein, a professor at Yale University who wasn't involved in the research. Gerstein specializes in applying computational approaches to molecular biology. ""Given the disparity observed for mothers in the study, one could easily envision an equally impactful relationship with either the genetics or age of the father,"" he says. ""This seems like a promising area for future research to explore."" Ralph Catalano, an emeritus professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, who also wasn't involved in the research, thinks that the study's narrow focus on sex at birth may not show the full picture. ""Fewer than 50% of conceptions reach birth. More than 50% are spontaneously aborted [miscarried], and that's not a random draw,"" he says. Due to immunological and developmental sensitivity, females are more likely to be spontaneously aborted early in pregnancy, while males are more vulnerable to spontaneous abortion later in pregnancy because they are physically frailer, he says. ""The sex of infants we see — those who make it to birth — is shaped as much by in utero selection as by sex at conception,"" he says. Another caveat is the composition of the sample. The Nurses' Health Study that the sample was drawn from is made up of overwhelmingly white women residing in the United States. ""Since sex preferences and reproductive behaviors vary across cultures, religions, or countries … the sex ratio distribution pattern observed in our study may not apply to other societies,"" the researchers acknowledge."
3,science,"Tiny variations in the weather, tides and even the liquid inside the Earth's core can affect the length of the day. NASA hide caption If today feels like it's flying by, you can blame it on our spinning planet: A group of scientists tracking Earth's rotation predicts that the day will be a fraction of a second shorter than normal. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service , which measures the Earth's rotation and forecasts the length of the day, has predicted that July 22 could come out about a millisecond short of a standard 24-hour spin. Variations in the Earth's rotation are not uncommon: On July 9, for example, the Earth's quick spin shortened the day by nearly 1.4 milliseconds. But recent headlines from all over the world have been hyping ""freakishly short"" days in July and August. Scientific experts who constantly monitor the Earth's rotation seem a bit baffled and amused that a few slightly more-speedy-than-normal spins this summer have captured the public's imagination. ""We've known about the rotation of the Earth being variable for about a hundred years,"" says Dennis McCarthy, the former director of time at the U.S. Naval Observatory. ""This is just one of those little variations that comes along."" McCarthy, who's literally written the book on time and Earth's rotation, says the speed of the planet's spin gets influenced by all kinds of factors: the gravitational influence of the moon, the effect of winds and the atmosphere, plus the movements of the Earth's liquid core. Good data on the Earth's rotation goes back thousands of years, thanks to observations of solar eclipses in China. These days, researchers around the world track the spinning of the globe by pointing radio telescopes at quasars, incredibly luminous cores of distant galaxies that are so far away, they act as fixed points in space. That kind of data, plus information from GPS systems, all gets sent to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, which uses it to forecast the day length. Predictions are also made by others, such as the U.S. Naval Observatory. Generally speaking, over millions of years, the Earth's rotation has been slowing down, a trend that's expected to continue into the future, says McCarthy. The main reason is the moon. The moon's gravitational pull on the Earth creates ocean tides, and a process called ""tidal braking"" gradually slows the Earth's spin. ""We know it's slowing down, because we have a real good idea of the effect of the moon,"" says McCarthy. ""Although that slowing down is continuing, there are departures from that general pattern."" Specifically, over the last decade or so, there's been a bumper crop of days that are somewhat short. Last year's shortest day, July 5, 2024, was 1.65 milliseconds shorter than the usual 86,400 seconds, says Thomas Herring , a geophysicist with MIT. He says that was the shortest day since the 1950s, which is when researchers started comparing the rotation of the Earth to the very accurate time standard provided by atomic clocks that measure the regular oscillations of atoms. In the past, the world's timekeepers have occasionally resorted to adding in some ""leap seconds"" — these extra seconds keep atomic time in sync with Earth's rotation as it slows. The last time an extra second was added to the clock was in 2016. The recent speedy spins of the Earth, however, raise the possibility of instituting ""negative leap seconds,"" or basically taking away a second rather than adding one, which is something that's never been done before. ""I think it will be unlikely that a negative leap second will be invoked,"" says Herring, given that regular old leap seconds seem to be falling out of favor. While he and others say that the recent short-duration days are of little significance in and of themselves, understanding and being able to predict the precise rotation of the Earth is important for all kinds of applications—everything from launching missiles to navigation to high-tech farming. At the equator, in one second, the Earth will rotate the length of four football fields, says Nick Stamatakos, head of the Earth orientation department at the U.S. Naval Observatory. ""The Earth's moving pretty fast,"" he says. ""So any little variations will accumulate, and it's an issue."" By looking at the recent rotation history along with information about weather systems and long-term patterns, researchers can make predictions about how the Earth will spin on any given day. These predictions generally get less accurate the farther out they go. While the moon has long been the major player in controlling the speed of the Earth's rotation, one study found that humans are playing a role. Climate change is melting ice at the poles and sending water down to the equator, slowing the rotation down. The researchers believe that this effect is already lengthening the days. Some have calculated that in a worst-case scenario, climate change could eventually redistribute water in a way that would make the days milliseconds longer. That would make humans, rather than the moon, the dominant driver of changes to day length. ""We can really become the dominant drivers of Earth's rotation, due to human-induced climate change,"" says lead researcher Benedikt Soja of ETH Zürich, a university in Switzerland. ""That was really surprising, and really an interesting revelation to us."""
4,health,"Sonya Sotinsky sits at Crane Cove Park in San Francisco on March 25. Sotinsky was diagnosed with Stage 4 tongue cancer and underwent surgery to remove her tongue, larynx and other structures. She then worked with researchers to create an AI-generated voice using past recordings of her speech. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption When doctors told her they had to remove her tongue and voice box to save her life from the cancer that had invaded her mouth, Sonya Sotinsky sat down with a microphone to record herself saying the things she would never again be able to say. This story was produced in partnership with KFF Health News . ""Happy birthday"" and ""I'm proud of you"" topped the phrases she banked for her husband and two daughters, as well as ""I'll be right with you,"" intended for customers at the architecture firm she co-owns in Tucson, Arizona. Thinking about the grandchildren she desperately hoped to see born one day, she also recorded herself reading more than a dozen children's books, from Eloise to Dr. Seuss, to one day play for them at bedtime. But one of the biggest categories of sound files she banked was a string of curse words and filthy sayings. If the voice is the primary expression of personality, sarcasm and profanity are essential to Sotinsky's. ""When you can't use your voice, it is very, very frustrating. Other people project what they think your personality is. I have silently screamed and screamed at there being no scream,"" said Sotinsky in a recent interview, referring to rudimentary voice technology or writing notes by hand. ""What the literal you-know-what?"" Fighting invasive oral cancer at age 51 forced Sotinsky to confront the existential importance of the human voice. Her unique intonation, cadence and slight New Jersey accent, she felt, were fingerprints of her identity. And she refused to be silenced. Sonya Sotinsky uses an app on her phone to talk with her daughter Ela Fuentevilla at Crane Cove Park in San Francisco on March 25. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption While her doctors and insurance company saved her life, they showed little interest in saving her voice, she said. So she set out on her own to research and identify the artificial intelligence company that could. It used the recordings Sotinsky banked of her natural voice to build an exact replica now stored in an app on her phone, allowing her to type and speak once again with a full range of sentiment and sarcasm. ""She got her sass back,"" said Sotinsky's daughter, Ela Fuentevilla, 23. ""When we heard her AI voice, we all cried, my sister, my dad and I. It's crazy similar."" It took close to a year for doctors to catch Sotinsky's cancer. She complained to her orthodontist and dentist multiple times about jaw pain and a strange sensation under her tongue. Then water began dribbling down her chin when she drank. When the pain got so intense she could no longer speak at the end of each day, Sotinsky insisted her orthodontist take a closer look. ""A shadow cast over his face. I saw it when he leaned back,"" she said, ""that look you don't want to see."" That's when she started recording. In the five weeks between her diagnosis and surgery to remove her entire tongue and voice box – in medical terms, a total glossectomy and laryngectomy – she banked as much of her voice as she could manage. ""Your voice is your identity,"" said Dr. Sue Yom , a radiation oncologist at UC-San Francisco, where Sotinsky got treatment. ""Communication is not only how we express ourselves and relate to other people, but also how we make sense of the world."" ""When the voice is no longer available, you can't hear yourself thinking out loud, you can't hear yourself interacting with other people,"" Yom said. ""It impacts how your mind works."" People who lose their voice box, she added, are at higher risk for long-term emotional distress , depression and physical pain compared with those who retain it after cancer treatment. Close to a third lose their job , and the social isolation can be profound. Most laryngectomy patients learn to speak again with an electrolarynx , a small battery-operated box held against the throat that produces a monotonic, mechanical voice. But without a tongue to shape her words, Sotinsky knew that wouldn't work for her. Dr. Sue Yom, a radiation oncologist, stands with a radiotherapy system used to deliver precise, high-dose radiation treatments for cancer patients at the University of California San Francisco's Mission Bay medical center on May 16. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption When Sotinsky had her surgery in January 2022, AI voices were still in their infancy. The best technology she could find yielded a synthetic version of her voice, but it was still flat and robotic, and others strained to understand her. She got by until mid-2024, when she read about tech companies using generative AI to replicate a person's full range of natural inflection and emotion. While companies can now recreate a person's voice from snippets of old home movies or even a one-minute voicemail, 30 minutes is the sweet spot. Sotinsky had banked hours in her children's book readings. ""Eloise saved my voice,"" Sotinsky said. Now she types what she wants to say into a text-to-speech app on her phone, called Whisper , which translates and broadcasts her AI voice through portable speakers. Sonya Sotinsky often uses a portable keyboard to talk using the text-to-speech software on her phone. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption Most doctors and speech therapists who work with head and neck cancer patients don't realize AI software can be used this way, Yom said, and with their focus on saving lives they often don't have the bandwidth to encourage patients to record their voices before they lose them in surgery. Health insurance companies likewise prioritize treatments that extend life over those that improve its quality — and typically avoid covering new technologies until data proves their actuarial value. Sotinsky and her daughter spent months wrangling with claims adjusters at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona , but the insurer refused to reimburse Sotinsky for the $3,000 she spent on her initial assistive speaking technology. ""Apparently, having a voice is not considered a medical necessity,"" Sotinsky quipped, her AI voice edged with sarcasm. Sotinsky now pays the $99 monthly fee for her AI voice clone out of pocket. ""While health plans cover both routine and life-saving care, assistive communication devices are typically not covered,"" said Teresa Joseph , a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. ""As AI provides opportunities to impact health, we imagine that coverage criteria will evolve nationally."" Sotinsky resolved to use her newfound voice to help others regain theirs. She stepped back from her work in architecture and built two websites detailing her voice banking journey — voicebanknow.com and glossectomygirl.com . She tells her story at conferences and webinars, including an oncology conference in Denver that Yom organized for 80 scientists. One doctor who attended, Jennifer De Los Santos , was so inspired by hearing Sotinsky's voice that she began laying the groundwork for a clinical trial on the impact AI technology has on patients' communication and quality of life. That type of research could generate the data health insurers need to measure actuarial value. ""And therefore justify coverage by insurance,"" said De Los Santos, a head and neck cancer researcher and professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Breast cancer survivors faced a similar battle in the 1980s and '90s, she added. Insurers initially refused to cover the cost of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, calling the procedure cosmetic and unnecessary. It took years of patient advocacy and carefully crafted data showing reconstruction had a profound impact on women's physical and emotional well-being before the federal government mandated insurance coverage in 1998. Both De Los Santos and Yom said research data on AI voice clones will likely follow a similar path, eventually proving that a fully functioning, natural-sounding voice can lead to not only a better life, but a longer one. Sonya Sotinsky has built two websites detailing her experience in voice banking and tells her story at conferences, including an oncology conference in Denver for 80 scientists. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption In recent months, Sotinsky's AI voice literally helped save her life. Her cancer had resurged in her lungs and liver. Her voice allowed her to communicate with her doctors and participate fully in developing the treatment plan. It showed her just how ""medically necessary"" having a voice is. She noticed that doctors and nurses took her more seriously. They didn't tune out the way people often did when she relied on her more robotic, synthesized voice. It seemed they saw her as more fully human. ""If someone can only communicate using a few words at a time, and not elaborate and interface more fully, it's natural that you can't detect that they have more depth of thought,"" she said. ""Being able to dialogue with my care team in a more seamless way is vital."" While doctors successfully treated her latest round of cancer, Sotinsky, now 55, said she is confronting her odds in a new way, facing the reality that she will likely die much sooner than she wants. All over again, she realized how crucial her voice is for maintaining perspective on life and a sense of humor in the face of death. ""I tend to forget and think I am fine, when in reality, this is forever now. Emotionally, you start to get cocky again and this was like, 'Whoa, b****, we ain't playing.' This cancer is real,"" Sotinsky said, typing her next phrase with a mischievous grin. ""Sarcasm is part of my love language.""

5,health,"In Montana, one man says Medicaid and the drug coverage he gets through it are what allow him to work. But a raise he has gotten could mean he loses Medicaid, so he says he decided to ""fudge the numbers."" Oona Zenda/KFF Health News hide caption MISSOULA, Mont. — As congressional Republicans finalized Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, one man who relies on that government-subsidized health coverage was trying to coax his old car to start after an eight-hour shift making sandwiches. James asked that only his middle name be used to tell his story so that he wouldn't lose health coverage or be accused of Medicaid fraud. He found his food service gig a few weeks into an addiction treatment program. The man, who is in his late 30s, said his boss ""hasn't been disappointed."" ""I'm a good worker,"" he said with a grin. James can get the prescription drugs that help him stabilize his life and hold down that job through Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program that covers people with low incomes or disabilities. Those drugs curb his desire for alcohol and treat long-standing conditions that exacerbate his addiction, including bipolar and insomnia disorders. But he hasn't qualified for the program in months, ever since his work hours increased and he received a raise of about $1 an hour. He exceeds his income eligibility limit of about $21,000 per year by roughly $50 a week. James said that despite his raise, he's struggling to cover routine expenses, such as keeping his car running and paying his phone bill. He said he can't afford the care he needs even on the cheapest insurance plan available to him through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace or through his job's health insurance plan. Even paying $60 a month for his sleep medications — one of six prescriptions he takes daily — is too expensive. ""I only saw one option,"" James said. ""Fudge the numbers."" James hasn't reported his new income to the state. That puts him at odds with congressional Republicans who justified adding hurdles to Medicaid by claiming the system is rife with waste, fraud and abuse. But James isn't someone sitting on his couch playing video games, the type of person House Speaker Mike Johnson and others said they would target as they sought to impose work requirements. Medicaid provides health coverage and long-term care to more than 70 million people in the United States. Those who study safety-net systems say it's extremely rare for enrollees to commit fraud to tap into that coverage. In fact, research shows that swaths of eligible people aren't enrolled in Medicaid, likely because the system is so confusing. And nearly two-thirds of people on Medicaid in 2023 had jobs, according to an analysis by KFF , a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Those transitioning off Medicaid may qualify for other subsidized or low-priced health plans through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace. But, as in James' case, such plans can have gaps in what care is covered, and more comprehensive private plans may be too expensive. So James and an unknown number of other people find themselves caught between working too much to qualify for Medicaid but earning too little to pay for their own health care. James considers himself to be a patriot and said that people shouldn't ""use government funding to just be lazy."" He agrees with the Republican argument that, if able, people should work if they receive Medicaid. “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” James Hiding his hours on the job from the government bothers him, especially since he feels he must lie to access the medical care that enables him to work. ""I don't want to be a fraud. I don't want to die,"" James said. ""Those shouldn't be the only two options."" On July 4, Trump signed into law the major tax and spending bill that makes it harder for low-income workers to get Medicaid. That includes requiring beneficiaries to work or go to school and adding paperwork to prove they meet a minimum number of hours on the job every six months. ""It's going to hurt people, whether they're playing by the rules or not,"" said Ben Sommers , a health economist at Harvard University. ""We see this vilification of mostly very hardworking people who are really struggling and are benefiting from a program that helps them stay alive."" James said he initially declined his raise because he worried about losing Medicaid. He had previously been kicked off the coverage about a month into his rehab program after finding work. To stay in the sober-living program he otherwise couldn't afford, James said, he dropped just enough hours at work to requalify for Medicaid and then soon picked up hours again. If he didn't earn more, he said, he had no chance of saving enough money to find housing after graduating from the treatment program. ""They'll give you a bone if you stay in the mud,"" James said. ""But you have to stay there."" That problem — becoming just successful enough to suddenly lose Medicaid — is common. It's called a benefit cliff, said Pamela Herd , who researches government aid at the University of Michigan. ""It just doesn't make any sense that someone gets a dollar pay raise and all of a sudden they lose all access to their health insurance,"" Herd said. She said a partial fix exists called continuous eligibility, which guarantees an individual's Medicaid coverage for a specific period, such as a year or longer. The goal is to give people time to adjust when they do earn more money. Continuous eligibility also helps maintain coverage for low-income workers with unpredictable hours and whose pay changes month to month. But Congress has moved in the other direction. Under the new law, policymakers limited windows of eligibility for able-bodied adults to every six months. That will put more people on the program's eligibility cliff, Herd said, in which they must decide between losing access to coverage or dropping hours at work. ""It is going to be a nightmare,"" Herd said. Those federal changes will be especially difficult for people with chronic conditions, such as James in Montana. Not that long ago, James wouldn't have been breaking the rules to access Medicaid because his state had 12-month continuous eligibility. But in 2023, Montana began requiring enrollees to report any change in their income within 10 days. James is proud of how far he has come. About a year ago, his body was breaking down. He couldn't hold a spoon to eat breakfast without whiskey — his hands shook too hard. He had alcohol-induced seizures. He said his memories from his unhealthiest times come in flashes: being put on a stretcher, the face of a worried landlord, ambulance lights in the background. James recently graduated from his treatment program. He's staying with a relative to save money as he and his girlfriend try to find an affordable place to rent — though even with Medicaid, finding housing feels like a stretch to him. He's taking classes part time to become a licensed addiction counselor. His dream is to help others survive addiction, and he also sees that career as a way out of poverty. To James, all his progress rides on keeping Medicaid a bit longer. ""Every time I get a piece of mail, I am terrified that I'm gonna open it up and it's gonna say I don't have Medicaid anymore,"" he said. ""I'm constantly in fear that it's gonna go away."" As of mid-July, officials hadn't noticed the extra $50 he makes each week.

6,business,"A General Motors logo is seen at the General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant in Hamtramck, Mich. on Jan. 27, 2020. Paul Sancya/AP hide caption In a quarterly earnings call with investors, the chief financial officer of General Motors said Tuesday morning that tariffs cost the company approximately $1.1 billion over three months, bringing the company's profit margin from 9% down to 6.1% — that is, from meeting their target profitability to falling several percentage points short. CFO Paul Jacobson said that so far, the company has only been able to reduce the blow to profits by a minimal amount. But they're hoping that will change. ""We're still tracking to offset at least 30% of the $4 to $5 billion full-year 2025 tariff impact,"" he said, through a combination of changes in manufacturing, ""targeted cost initiatives,"" and the prices that consumers pay. U.S. tariff policy has been unpredictable and rapidly changing over the last few months , and GM executives acknowledged that's likely to continue. For example, the possibility of bilateral deals between the U.S. and other countries suggests that some of those costs might be avoided entirely. For now, despite a tariff of 25%, GM is still importing vehicles it makes in Korea, including some of its most affordable models. ""They're very much in demand,"" CEO Mary Barra told investors. GM stock dropped 6% after it revealed its earnings, signaling Wall Street's displeasure with the company's strategy so far of absorbing tariffs as a hit to profits. ""To put full year targets in reach,"" analysts Daniel Roska and Christopher Gray of research and brokerage firm Bernstein wrote in a note, ""GM needs to start mitigating tariff cost."" Meanwhile, Stellantis, the automaker that owns the Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Ram brands, reported this week that it paid about $387 million in tariffs over the last quarter, and that production pauses — a strategy to avoid paying tariffs — contributed to a 6% year-over-year decline in the number of vehicles the company shipped to dealers. Industry-wide data has suggested that, at least so far, car manufacturers have mostly absorbed higher tariffs as a hit to their profits, rather than passing them along to customers (many of whom are already balking at new car prices that average nearly $49,000 .) The most recent data from Kelley Blue Book showed the average price that car buyers paid for new vehicles in June was up 1.2% year over year, well below the 10-year average annual increase. ""The modest increase in transaction prices suggests the businesses are absorbing more of the burden and not passing the added costs to consumers — something that will impact profitability if the trend persists,"" Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, wrote in a post accompanying the data."
7,business,"President Trump with Jerome Powell after nominating him as chair in 2017. Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America hide caption President Trump indicated on Tuesday he would let Jerome Powell serve out his term as Federal Reserve chair, saying ""he's going to be out pretty soon anyway."" The comment comes as the president has relentlessly attacked Powell in recent weeks for not cutting interest rates. Last week, Trump floated the idea of firing Powell before retreating somewhat and adding he's ""not planning"" to fire the Fed chair, though without fully ruling it out. An attempt to fire Powell could spark a legal battle, because the Federal Reserve is set up to function as an independent body free of political interference. Such a move would likely also roil financial markets. On Tuesday, while answering questions from reporters, Trump again attacked Powell for being too cautious on cutting interest rates. ""I call him too late. He's too late all the time,"" Trump said. ""He should have lowered interest rates many times."" He went on to say that Powell is leaving his post soon enough anyway, indicating he was willing to wait out his term as chair of the Fed, which ends on May of next year. Despite the president's attacks, Powell has been adamant he intends to serve out his term as chair. The Fed has held interest rates steady this year in large part over concerns that President Trump's tariffs could spark an increase on inflation. That's after cutting rates by a full percentage point between September and December last year. With concerns over inflation rising again, the Fed is seen as unlikely to cut rates at its next policy meeting later this month. In June, consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year ago , a faster annual clip than in the previous month. Policy makers had previously indicated they may consider cutting rates by half a percentage point later this year. Top government officials have also stepped up their criticism of Powell's tenure at the Fed. On Monday, in a post on social media platform X, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for ""a review"" of the Fed's operations, saying the central bank had excessively extended its purview into areas outside of its core job of setting interest rates. Bessent also called for a review of the Fed's renovation project, which President Trump and some Republican lawmakers have seized on to further attack Powell. The Fed is embarking on a makeover of its offices in Washington, D.C., with the cost of the project soaring from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion in recent years. Powell has pushed back against some of the most sensational claims of the renovations as exaggerated. The Fed has attributed the cost overruns to unexpected developments like excess lead and asbestos, as well as inflation, which has raised the cost of building projects nationwide. Powell has also asked the Fed's inspector general to review the project, in an effort to address complaints about the price tag."
8,climate,"Experts say there are key questions parents and guardians should ask camp operators about wildfires, flood and heat risk. Danielle Villasana for The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption The deaths of at least 27 children and staff at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas have some parents and guardians questioning the safety of summer camps, especially as global warming increases risks of extreme weather. Part of summer camp's allure is that children are outside in nature. But that can also raise the possibility of heat illness and risks from greater proximity to wildfire or flood-prone areas, says Tracey Gaslin,  chief executive of the nonprofit Alliance for Camp Health in Kentucky. Outside of regulations that apply to all businesses, there are no federal standards that are specific to camps, says Henry DeHart, interim chief executive of the American Camp Association (ACA). The ACA has a national accreditation program that includes some health and safety standards, but it's voluntary and only about 12% of the country's roughly 20,000 camps have participated, he says. On the state level, DeHart says some state agencies conduct camp health and safety inspections. But oversight and protections vary considerably from state to state, and some states have very little regulation. ""There are a lot of states that have very little or no regulation related to camp,"" DeHart says. ""The regulatory framework is wide and varied and, in some places, it's not very robust."" Because of the gaps in the current regulatory framework, some experts on climate-related risks say parents and guardians should ask more detailed questions about campers' safety. Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers , dropped off his 8-year-old daughter at Girl Scout Camp earlier this month, and realized he, too, had many more questions about his daughter's camp's flood precautions. ""Even as a floodplain manager,"" he says, ""I don't think I even had appreciation for what, as a parent, I should be thinking about when sending kids to camp."" Now, Berginnis has a list of points to cover. For parents or guardians sending children to any kind of camp, here are the top questions experts say you should be asking about increased risks of heat, wildfires and floods. Camps can be great for kids, but can also expose them to heat. Children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies. Serhii Bezrukyi/Getty Images hide caption This question is important because heat-related illness and death are major and growing risks in the U.S. —and that threat is often underestimated. Also, children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies, says Rupa Basu,  senior science advisor for the University of California, San Francisco Center for Climate Health and Equity . That makes them more at risk for heat illness, she says. ""I  think that people don't even think of children often as being high risk populations,"" Basu says. "" But they absolutely are."" For these reasons, Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health thinks parents and guardians should be asking camps how they are thinking about heat and hydration. She suggests parents and guardians ask about how the camp's physical site is designed. "" Do you have things like shade structures? Misting systems?"" Gaslin says. ""A really solid infrastructure build is important."" Gaslin also thinks parents and guardians should be asking about how ""climate-aware"" the campers' schedules are. That can look like an activity in a cool location, then an activity outside in a warmer location, then back into the cool, she says. Also it's important to ask about how frequently counselors are reminding campers to hydrate. ""It's really about giving conscious thought to how do we manage that impact of heat,"" she says. "" If we're gonna be outdoors, guess what? Water activities are a great thing to do."" Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP hide caption This question is key because many camps are located in flood-prone areas, Berginnis says. He says – in many ways – that's understandable. ""To me, it makes logical sense that you'd have a lot of camps there because it has really interesting habitats. It has interesting animals and geology and everything, and kids can learn a lot there,"" Berginnis says. But he thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Berginnis says adults can look up risks on this FEMA website . Parents and guardians can also plug in addresses to this database from First Street , a climate risk modeling company. If it's a sleep-away camp, Berginnis says it's important to ask where the kids' sleeping quarters are located. ""If it's an overnight camp, any kind of residential lodging overnight for the kids, if it's in a floodway, that should be a huge red flag right there,"" he says. And he says parents and guardians should ask camps about things like flood sirens and specifics of emergency action plans. "" I would be very blunt with a campground: I wanna know the procedure. If a flash flood warning is declared for the area, what does the camp do? What do the counselors do? So that they can talk it through with you,"" he says in an email. ""Do not be satisfied with a generic answer like 'we have an emergency action plan'. Ask them about specific actions like is there anyone monitoring the weather at night? What are the designated evacuation areas? And if they cannot talk that through with you, again, I would say, that's another red flag."" Tracey Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health says parents and guardians should make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images hide caption As with flood risks, parents and guardians should be asking about emergency action plans and preparedness for wildfire and smoke, Gaslin says. ""Parents can ask camps, do they monitor air quality?"" she says, ""What's their evacuation plan? How are they gonna communicate with families? So families are gonna be able to say, in a moment of crisis, I wanna be able to communicate with you in some way."" Gaslin says it's important to make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Gaslin says parents and guardians should make sure there are always staff monitoring the weather, and at sleepaway camps there should be a solid communication system so at night, individuals are alerted to environmental changes or concerns. That means at least some staff with cell phones and radios at all hours, to monitor for wildfire risk, flash floods, or any other hazards."
9,climate,"People swim in the Blanco River by a low water crossing on River Road across from 7A Ranch in Wimberley, Texas, on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption WIMBERLEY, Texas — On a hot and humid mid-July afternoon, cars rumble down the streets of downtown Wimberley. Visitors browse Western-themed shops boasting vintage cowboy boots, cacti and local wine. Fourth of July banners blow in the wind, lining a bridge spanning a small creek that trickles through town. People float on inner tubes in the nearby Blanco River, sipping beers and splashing in the water. Ten years ago, this area was practically unrecognizable. On Memorial Day weekend in 2015, the Blanco River suddenly rose more than 40 feet in the middle of the night, swelling to about a quarter of a mile wide in some places and carrying away nearly everything in its path. At least 12 people were killed, including several children, and hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, according to local authorities. Since then, the small town of roughly 3,000 has focused on rebuilding itself with a potential flood like that in mind, installing new safety measures and alert systems with financial help from the state. But residents and government officials say that the recent deadly, destructive flooding in nearby Kerr County earlier this month has reinforced the need for more preparedness in flood-prone areas like Wimberley. It's also reopened old emotional wounds that still hadn't fully healed. ""It's really hard for us to watch the news right now, because it's just so eerily similar to what we went through that night 10 years ago,"" says resident and business owner Natalie Meeks. Natalie Meeks, co-owner of Water's Point Resort, said that she and her husband are constructing this building to be 3 feet higher than the updated flood maps for the area. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption She and her husband run a vacation resort along the Blanco River, which has been in his family for nearly a hundred years. Today, the river is calm, down a bank and a few hundred feet away from the nearest cabins. But during the flood, Meeks says those cabins ended up 20 feet under water. She and her husband woke up in the middle of the night to phone calls and alerts from people upriver, and rushed to the cabins to pull guests out — in some cases, physically carrying them — trying to find higher ground as the property was swallowed by the river. Loading... ""The only light source we had was lightning and transformers blowing,"" Meeks remembers. ""All you could hear was the ancient cypress trees just snapping, and the river just wasn't stopping."" She says they could hear houses being carried down the river, the people inside screaming for help. There was nothing they could do. All 100 guests and Meeks' family survived that night, but the water washed two of the cabins away. The rest of the structures were severely damaged. Meeks says it took nearly a year just to clear debris after the flood. Since then, it's been one project after another. On the far end of the Meeks' vacation resort, a cabin built on stilts engineered to withstand the rush of future flood waters is in the middle of construction. ""Even after seeing the aftermath of the flood, I didn't comprehend how much time and money it would take to rebuild. It's overwhelming,"" Meeks says, noting that it's not just about the physical rebuilding. ""It's emotional for a long time. It's just a long, long process."" This area in central Texas has long been known as Flash Flood Alley. Droughts cause rivers to run nearly dry for months, sometimes years at a time; heavy rains then make them suddenly overflow. Locals know that floods are part of life; often, they welcome the rain to replenish the water in swimming areas popular with tourists. But so-called 100-year-floods have been happening more frequently , as climate change is driving more intense rain storms across much of the U.S., dropping more water in shorter periods of time. This month's disaster in Kerr County has some of Wimberley's residents thinking about the possibility of another flood in their area, says Mayor Jim Chiles, who was not mayor at the time of the 2015 flood but has been since May 2024. Jim Chiles, mayor of Wimberley, Texas, is photographed at the local Dairy Queen on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Mayor Chiles says he has already had talks with city leaders about putting flooding infrastructure and safety front and center, specifically looking into an audible, citywide alert system like sirens, something many communities in the area are talking about as the death toll from Kerr County's floods has hit at least 130. Many think that might have helped save lives, especially when flooding happens in the middle of the night. ""It's all very premature, but we had an agenda setting meeting,"" he says. ""We put something on there to talk about sirens. Sirens are very expensive, and we gotta figure out how to do that."" He says he's hopeful the state will step in to help with it. Ten years after the 2015 Memorial Day flood in Wimberley, Texas, the Water's Point Resort is in the construction process for replacing the last cabin on the property to be lost during the flood. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption After Wimberley's flood in 2015, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott transferred $6.8 million from a state disaster contingency fund for statewide floodplain management, as well as more river gauges, which monitor the level of the water and send real-time information to weather alert systems. Wimberley's then-mayor Steve Thurber secured several new  gauges for the town, which only had one before the flood and was swept away during the storm. Since then, three have been installed upriver, allowing for much more accurate monitoring. But securing more funding will likely be difficult. Kerr County tried for years — and ultimately failed — to find a way to pay for a new alert system, including sirens. And now, prospects are even more limited, as the Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions of dollars dedicated to help rural communities prepare for disasters. Seventy-seven year-old Jim Venable has lived in Wimberley for most of his life, and while he hopes more infrastructure for flooding and alerts will be put in, he's not optimistic. ""Well, it's always about the dollars, right? You know, how much are the people worth?,"" he says. Jim Venable, 77, a construction superintendent in Wimberley Texas, poses for a portrait at the Wimberley Visitor Center on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Venable was a construction contractor nearby in Austin before the flooding. But afterward, he quit that job to focus on rebuilding Wimberley. ""I think there's still a lot of PTSD after the fact,"" he says, adding that over the Fourth of July weekend, as Kerr County flooded, residents in Wimberley were on edge. ""We're just looking at the rain, and we're just going, well, is that going to hit here or what's going to happen?"" Wimberley sits in Hays County, one of the fastest-growing counties in both Texas and the U.S, according to recent census data . In the summer, the population booms as it welcomes tourists and seasonal summer residents alike, according to town officials. The town is just 40 miles from Austin, making it a popular vacation spot for city dwellers. Venable says he welcomes the extra people coming to enjoy the town, but their presence highlights an even greater need for flood protections. ""We keep inviting people to come in, but we've got to protect them and take care of them, because we're apt to get these storms anytime,"" he says. Gabrielle Snyder, visitor services coordinator with the City of Wimberley, poses for a portrait at the Wimberley Visitor Center on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Gabrielle Snyder works as a visitor services coordinator for Wimberley's tourism department. She says since the flooding in Kerr County, she's had tourists call, concerned about upcoming trips to Wimberley. ""You want to be sympathetic and supportive, but we weren't affected by these latest floods,"" she says. She says part of her job is telling visitors about the need to sign up for flood alert systems and participate in emergency preparedness. But she has to walk a fine line, because the town wants — and needs — people to come. ""Obviously, Wimberley knows better than a lot of communities how devastating this situation is, but at the same time, you know, Wimberley is open,"" Snyder says. A ""Wimberley Strong"" flag flies at the Village Store in Wimberley, Texas, on July 9. The flag was created after the 2015 Memorial Day flood, which killed at least a dozen people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Her house flooded back in 2015, forcing her, her husband and her daughter, who was 9 years old at the time, to quickly grab what they could and evacuate. It was a rental property, and the damage was so severe that it was eventually torn down. For a time, they lived in an RV borrowed from a friend, until they bought a home in a different part of Wimberley — with one major requirement. ""Never again will we live on the river,"" Snyder says. After witnessing what a powerful flood can do, she says she's fine with appreciating the river from a distance."
