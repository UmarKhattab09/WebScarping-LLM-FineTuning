politics,"President Trump meets with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Oval Office at the White House on July 22. During a question-and-answer session with reporters while at the meeting, Trump railed against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption The Justice Department on Tuesday said it is in touch with an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , to try to arrange a meeting with her in the coming days. President Trump said he thought the development ""sounds appropriate,"" though he also claimed to know nothing about it. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the plan on social media, saying that the department is seeking any information from Maxwell — who is serving time for sex trafficking — as part of its quest to uncover ""all credible evidence"" in the Epstein case. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, is facing a backlash from supporters who want more information released about the disgraced financier's crimes and his 2019 death by suicide in prison. Trump has dismissed the uproar as a politically driven ""witch hunt"" distracting from his agenda. Asked about the newest development on Tuesday, he told reporters, ""I don't really follow that too much."" His comments to reporters came while he was meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines on trade issues. After the meeting, Trump announced on social media that importers of goods from the Philippines will face a 19% tariff , while U.S. exports to the country will face no tariffs. Trump spent most of his time in the Oval Office question-and-answer session railing against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, recently published materials that she claims show that Obama officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ""It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. So you ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,"" Trump told reporters — the ""nonsense"" referring to the Epstein controversy. Trump said it was ""time to go after people"" in connection to his allegations about the 2016 election. Obama's office issued a rare response, calling Trump's statements ""outrageous"" and noting that conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election had been widely accepted. ""These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in the statement. Republicans in Congress have also been grappling with the Epstein issue. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced Tuesday that the House would finish work a day early, canceling votes scheduled for later in the week. That means members will leave town for an annual August recess without a fresh confrontation over Epstein. The schedule change was announced after repeated clashes among Republicans about the files, including a deadlock in the powerful House Rules Committee over an effort by Democrats to force additional votes on the Epstein matter.

science,"Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. They impact almost every part of the body, including the heart, brain and even emotions. nicoletaionescu/Getty Images hide caption Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. They impact almost every part of the body, including the heart, brain and even emotions. Eating disorders among teenagers skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teens like Moorea Friedmann were isolated, spending more time in front of their computers watching movies and TV, where characters often seemed... perfect. ""You see the protagonist and they're all so beautiful,"" Friedmann says. ""And you're like, 'Do I have to look like that to be worthy? To be lovable?'"" Friedmann was already struggling with perfectionism and anxiety, and says she started to feel awful about herself. ""The world was spiraling out of control, and my body was spiraling out of control. And so what did I try to do? I tried to control it,"" she says. Eventually, Friedmann says she stopped getting her period, a condition called amenorrhea that signals the body's hormones aren't functioning properly. A doctor told her that her heart wasn't doing well, and Friedmann realized she was stuck in patterns that were hurting her mind and body. Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. Pediatrician Eva Trujillo says they ""literally rewire the brain,"" decrease brain size, and make it harder to concentrate and to regulate emotions. Malnutrition can slow the metabolism, impact bone density and even lead to cardiac arrest. Trujillo says that with the right treatment, people can also recover fully. ""But the brain needs time, food, therapy and compassion to heal,"" she says. Trujillo is the president of the International Association of Eating Disorder Professionals . She is also a co-founder of Comenzar de Nuevo , a leading treatment facility in Latin America, where patients of all ages and walks of life can get support and skill-build as they recover. For Friedmann, recovery also includes advocating for other teens struggling with eating disorders and other mental health conditions. She started a mental health and wellness podcast called Balancing Act . ""As I was digging myself out of this hole, I realized that I wanted to help other people who felt like they had been battling with this alone,"" she says. ""Because I knew what it was like to struggle alone."" For more resources and support, check out the National Eating Disorders Association . Want us to cover more mental health topics?

health,"Anopheles mosquito, Culicidae. De Agostini Editorial/via Getty Images hide caption Each year, 263 million people get malaria. But from the parasite's perspective, infecting humans is harder than you might think, and requires completing an epic journey within the tiny body of a mosquito. First, the mosquito must suck the blood of an individual infected with malaria — bringing the Plasmodium parasite into the insect's gut. Then the parasite must travel to the critter's salivary glands, where it's poised to be injected into the mosquito's next victim via a bite. Now a team of researchers have found a way to interrupt this crucial journey. By using gene editing to make a tiny tweak to the mosquito's genome — one that changes just a single amino acid — parasites were largely prevented from reaching their final destination. The change effectively rendered laboratory mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria , researchers report Wednesday in Nature. ""The idea that you could change just one amino acid and not have the parasite transmitted is a pretty big deal,"" says Fred Gould , an entomologist at North Carolina State University who wasn't involved in the study. ""It's really exciting."" That tiny tweak could be spread through a whole mosquito population using a gene drive, a genetic technology that breaks the normal 50-50 rules of inheritance. Gene drives are sequences of DNA that can be inserted into the genome of an individual and cause a specific mutation or gene to be passed on to virtually all offspring, instead of just 50%. Eventually, researchers hope to engineer mosquitoes with this approach and release them into the wild. ""These mosquitoes will spread on their own and gradually transform the malaria-transmitting mosquito population to one that cannot transmit malaria,"" says George Dimopoulos , a biologist at Johns Hopkins University and study co-author. Dimopoulos isn't claiming this technique will be the final nail in malaria's coffin, and it's far from being ready for release. It'll likely be several years, at least, before field tests, and will require buy-in and approval by local communities and governments. But he argues new genetic tools are needed to quash the disease, since existing ones like bed nets and antimalarial drugs haven't been able to turn malaria — which kills 600,000 a year — into a disease of the past. But gene drive technology is controversial. ""Gene drives could have far-reaching, unpredictable negative consequences,"" says Dana Perls , senior program manager on emerging technologies at Friends of the Earth, an environmental non-profit. Because they distort normal patterns of inheritance, ""the genetic changes from a gene drive to a population of mosquitoes are very likely to persist for a long time, possibly permanently."" Critics worry that gene drives designed to spread one tiny change to the genome could end up mutating to affect other parts of the genome. That could result in unanticipated changes spreading fast through a population before researchers would have a chance to stop it, potentially upending the delicate balance of an ecosystem. Still, researchers are exploring several gene editing strategies. Some aim to suppress mosquito populations by rendering individuals infertile. But there are worries that wiping out mosquitoes could have unintended consequences for ecosystems — for example by removing a food source for birds and bats. Another strategy is to engineer mosquitoes with new genes that would make proteins that mess with the parasite itself, curbing transmission without harming the bugs. Dimopoulos and his colleagues wanted to take a different approach, one that messed with the parasite, but without adding an entirely new gene. They settled on a gene called FREP1 . It helps mosquitoes feed on blood. But it also appears to be important to the parasites, which use it to complete their crucial journey to the salivary glands in ways researchers don't fully understand. Some mosquitoes have a small genetic change that seems to disrupt this journey. The researchers used CRISPR, a gene editing technology that can very precisely change the genome, to create two nearly-identical Anopheles stephensi groups, one with the normal FREP1 gene and one with the variant. The variant is very small, changing just one amino acid, the basic building blocks of proteins. But that small change had big effects. Mosquitoes with the edited variant have about 5 times fewer infective parasites in the salivary glands, a median of zero compared with thousands in non-edited mosquitoes. There were significantly fewer parasites in the gut, too. Otherwise, the insects appeared perfectly healthy. It's unclear exactly how much this genetic tweak would impair a mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. But previous research suggests ""something on the order of a 90% reduction in malaria transmission would be more or less what you'd expect,"" says Ethan Bier , a geneticist at the University of California San Diego and study co-author. ""I was surprised myself that a single amino acid change could do that."" Next, the researchers showed that they could rapidly spread this beneficial change with a gene drive. It took just 10 generations for the variant to spread to over 90% of their laboratory population. ""It's really excellent work,"" says Anthony James , a molecular biologist at the University of California Irvine who wasn't involved in the study, but works on introducing new resistance genes to mosquitoes. Since the change is naturally occurring, he says it could be ""marginally more acceptable"" to people wary of genetic engineering. ""It's good to have more than one approach available,"" he says. That's especially important if the malaria parasite evolves resistance against these new tools.",Critical
business,"President Trump displays an executive order on artificial intelligence he signed in Washington, DC, on July 23, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images hide caption President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order requiring artificial intelligence companies that do business with the federal government to strip AI models of ""ideological agendas."" Speaking at an AI summit in Washington, Trump said: ""The American people do not want woke Marxist lunacy in the AI models."" The order bans federal agencies from contracting with tech companies that operate AI chatbots displaying partisan bias, which the action defines as diversity, equity and inclusion, critical race theory, ""transgenderism"" — forces the order says pose ""an existential threat to reliable AI."" ""From now on, the U.S. government will deal only with AI that pursues truth, fairness and strict impartiality,"" Trump said. The White House is also planning to revise Biden-era federal guidelines for AI safety to remove references to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change and misinformation, according to the Trump administration's AI action plan released on Wednesday. These are the latest instances of the Trump administration turning the screws on DEI initiatives and railing against popular AI chatbots. Trump supporters have increasingly criticized the technology, saying safety guardrails end up censoring conservative views. ""The AI industry is deeply concerned about this situation,"" said Neil Sahota, a technologist who advises the United Nations on artificial intelligence issues. ""They're already in a global arms race with AI, and now they're being asked to put some very nebulous measures in place to undo protections because they might be seen as woke,"" he said. ""It's freaking tech companies out."" One possible way AI companies could respond, according to Sahota, is to unveil ""anti-woke"" versions of their chatbots with fewer safeguards in order to land the lucrative business of the federal government. ""If you're a tech company with a lot of government contracts, this order is a sticky wicket,"" Sahota said. While some studies have shown that popular chatbots can at times deliver left-of-center responses to certain policy questions, experts say it can often come down to how a question is framed, or what part of the internet the system is summarizing. AI scholars say there is no proof that any major chatbot has been intentionally designed to generate liberal answers and censor conservative views. ""Often what is happening with these criticisms is that a chatbot doesn't align with someone's respective viewpoint, so they want to place the blame on the model,"" said Chinasa Okolo, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, DC. Turning ""woke AI"" into a rallying cry has parallels to a previous conservative battering ram against Silicon Valley: the belief that content guidelines on social media platforms were devised to muzzle right-wing perspectives. Last year, the howls over chatbots being ""woke"" intensified when Google's Gemini image generator depicted Black and Asian men as being U.S. founding fathers and Vikings as being ethnically diverse. Google executives apologized, and the company explained Gemini had overcorrected for diversity, including ""cases that should clearly not show a range."" Developing policies to counter such episodes has become a focus for White House AI czar David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, a senior policy advisor in the Trump administration. It is a striking reversal from how the Biden administration approached the technology, when officials sought ways to enact barriers against AI perpetuating bias and potentially violating peoples' civil rights. Now, new energy has been breathed into making AI a part of the larger culture wars. Conservative activists seized on the Google Gemini snafu, but when Elon Musk's Grok chatbot flew off the rails earlier this month and launched into antisemitic tirades, few right-wing commentators responded. Just days later, the maker of Grok, Musk's xAI, was awarded a Defense Department contract  worth up to $200 million, along with Google, Anthropic and OpenAI. ""Musk's original vision for xAI was a sort of 'anti-woke AI,' but when you control poorly for data quality and disable safeguards, you get things like the recent Nazi episode,"" said Talia Ringer, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. xAI blamed outdated software code on the meltdown. In particular, instructions that told Grok to be ""maximally based,"" a slang term for holding strong opinions even if they are troubling, which was reinforced by a similar instruction given to the chatbot: ""You tell like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct."" The company said the issue has been fixed. Most popular chatbots have protections against things like slurs, harassment and hate speech, basic guardrails that may now be under new scrutiny by the Trump administration. ""Most of the examples I've seen conservatives cite of AI being too 'woke' are LLMs refusing to confirm conspiracy theories or racist claims,"" said Ringer, using the abbreviation for large language models, which underpin chatbot technology. To Okolo at the Brookings Institution, the battle over whether chatbots perpetuate left- or right-leaning views is overshadowed by another fight over the acceptance of provable facts. ""Some people, unfortunately, believe that basic facts with scientific basis are left-leaning, or 'woke,' and this does skew their perceptions a bit,"" she said. Doing the work of changing AI systems to respond to the White House executive order will be messy, said technologist Sahota, because where lines are drawn, and why, can initiate all sorts of political and cultural firestorms. ""What is even politically-driven? In this day and age, if someone says something about the importance of vaccination for measles, is that now a politically charged discussion?"" he said. ""But if there's potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in future federal contracts on the line, companies might have to do something, or they could be putting a serious amount of revenue in jeopardy.""",Critical
climate,"Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister for climate change, is joined by climate activists at the International Court of Justice on Wednesday. The country pushed for years for the court to hear its first major climate change case. Peter Dejong/AP hide caption The top United Nations court has ruled that nations are obligated under international law to limit climate change, and countries that don't act could be held legally responsible for climate damages elsewhere. The decision is a win for many small countries vulnerable to climate impacts, which pushed for the issue to be heard by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It's the court's first major ruling on climate change, but the decision is only advisory, meaning that countries are not legally bound by it. Still, legal experts say it could be a boost for other climate change lawsuits pending in national courts around the world. ""It's really groundbreaking,"" says Maria Antonia Tigre, director of Global Climate Change Litigation at Columbia Law School. ""I think it will create this new wave of climate litigation."" The case was championed by the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, which has been among the loudest voices calling for stronger international climate action, alongside other island nations. The low-lying countries face dire risks from rising sea levels and more intense cyclones. In court proceedings in December, Vanuatu and other nations argued that countries have an obligation to act on climate change under international laws protecting the environment and human rights. In a ruling today, the ICJ agreed . ""In order to guarantee the effective enjoyment of human rights, states must take measures to protect the climate system and other parts of the environment,"" Judge Yuji Iwasawa read from the court's opinion. The court also found that if countries fail to curb their heat-trapping emissions from fossil fuels, they could be on the hook to pay for climate change-related damages in other countries. Those kinds of payments have been a point of contention between major emitters and lower-income counties at annual climate change negotiations. The U.S. generally doesn't consider ICJ decisions to be binding. Earlier this year, President Trump also pulled the U.S. out of the major international climate accord, the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Still, smaller countries say they hope the ICJ's decision will be a turning point in international climate negotiations. ""Today it's been a landmark milestone for climate action,"" said Vanuatu's climate minister Ralph Regenvanu. ""It's a very important course correction in this critically important time."" For years, low-lying countries around the world have argued that climate change is an existential threat. Sea levels have already risen about 8 inches since the Industrial Revolution, and the pace is accelerating. Vanuatu is looking at relocating entire villages from the coast. Cyclones have taken a toll on the South Pacific country and are getting more intense as the climate heats up. With a population of around 300,000, Vanuatu has produced a relatively tiny share of global emissions from burning fossil fuels, which trap heat and warm the planet. The majority of emissions have come from larger and richer countries such as the U.S., the European Union and China. But Vanuatu officials argue it's bearing the brunt of the problem. ""We find ourselves on the front lines of a crisis we did not create, a crisis that threatens our very existence,"" Regenvanu said before the ICJ last December. Vanutau led a coalition of countries to call for the ICJ to rule on climate change, spurred on by a group of students from the Pacific Islands . The court, based at the Hague, rules on international law and disputes between countries. Close to 100 countries filed testimonies, making it the largest case the court has heard . The court took up two questions: are countries obligated to act on climate change, and what are the legal consequences if they cause harm? At the hearings, the U.S. argued that negotiations through international agreements such as the Paris climate accord are the best way to address climate change. ""Cooperative efforts through that regime provide the best hope for protecting the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations,"" said Margaret Taylor, who represented the U.S. Department of State in the legal proceedings under the Biden administration. In its ruling today, the ICJ found that countries are bound to curb emissions of greenhouse gases under international law. That includes taking actions such as limiting the use and production of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas – and even government subsidies for those industries. It also found that states can be held responsible for specific damage caused by climate change. That's made possible by advances in climate science that are helping to pinpoint how much climate change contributes to specific disasters. At the same time, the ICJ recognized that the advisory ruling may have a minimal impact. ""International law… has an important but ultimately limited role in resolving this problem,"" the judgment reads. ""A complete solution to this daunting, and self-inflicted, problem requires the contribution of all fields of human knowledge, whether law, science, economics or any other."" The case could influence hundreds of other climate change lawsuits around the world, adding evidence for plaintiffs who are seeking to spur governments to act. Cases have been filed in the U.S. and European countries like the Netherlands, where a court ruled that the Dutch state must cut its greenhouse gas emissions . ""This being really the biggest case that we have seen in climate litigation, the status and the weight of the court can really influence a lot of these cases,"" Tigre says. The ICJ decision could also be cited at the COP30 international climate negotiations this fall in Brazil. There, smaller nations like Vanuatu will continue to make the case for compensation from wealthier countries for the damages from climate change, known as ""loss and damage"" payments. Climate activists, like Vishal Prasad of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, say the decision provides new momentum for their movement. ""I think it sends a strong message for all of us and to young people everywhere,"" Prasad says. ""There is still hope and there is a chance and there's a reason for us to keep fighting.""",Critical
