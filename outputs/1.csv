politics,"President Trump meets with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Oval Office at the White House on July 22. During a question-and-answer session with reporters while at the meeting, Trump railed against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption The Justice Department on Tuesday said it is in touch with an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , to try to arrange a meeting with her in the coming days. President Trump said he thought the development ""sounds appropriate,"" though he also claimed to know nothing about it. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the plan on social media, saying that the department is seeking any information from Maxwell — who is serving time for sex trafficking — as part of its quest to uncover ""all credible evidence"" in the Epstein case. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, is facing a backlash from supporters who want more information released about the disgraced financier's crimes and his 2019 death by suicide in prison. Trump has dismissed the uproar as a politically driven ""witch hunt"" distracting from his agenda. Asked about the newest development on Tuesday, he told reporters, ""I don't really follow that too much."" His comments to reporters came while he was meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines on trade issues. After the meeting, Trump announced on social media that importers of goods from the Philippines will face a 19% tariff , while U.S. exports to the country will face no tariffs. Trump spent most of his time in the Oval Office question-and-answer session railing against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, recently published materials that she claims show that Obama officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ""It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. So you ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,"" Trump told reporters — the ""nonsense"" referring to the Epstein controversy. Trump said it was ""time to go after people"" in connection to his allegations about the 2016 election. Obama's office issued a rare response, calling Trump's statements ""outrageous"" and noting that conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election had been widely accepted. ""These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in the statement. Republicans in Congress have also been grappling with the Epstein issue. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced Tuesday that the House would finish work a day early, canceling votes scheduled for later in the week. That means members will leave town for an annual August recess without a fresh confrontation over Epstein. The schedule change was announced after repeated clashes among Republicans about the files, including a deadlock in the powerful House Rules Committee over an effort by Democrats to force additional votes on the Epstein matter.

science,"Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. They impact almost every part of the body, including the heart, brain and even emotions. nicoletaionescu/Getty Images hide caption Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. They impact almost every part of the body, including the heart, brain and even emotions. Eating disorders among teenagers skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teens like Moorea Friedman were isolated, spending more time in front of their computers watching movies and TV, where characters often seemed... perfect. ""You see the protagonist and they're all so beautiful,"" Friedman says. ""And you're like, 'Do I have to look like that to be worthy? To be lovable?'"" Friedman was already struggling with perfectionism and anxiety, and says she started to feel awful about herself. ""The world was spiraling out of control, and my body was spiraling out of control. And so what did I try to do? I tried to control it,"" she says. Eventually, Friedman says she stopped getting her period, a condition called amenorrhea that signals the body's hormones aren't functioning properly. A doctor told her that her heart wasn't doing well, and Friedman realized she was stuck in patterns that were hurting her mind and body. Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. Pediatrician Eva Trujillo says they ""literally rewire the brain,"" decrease brain size, and make it harder to concentrate and to regulate emotions. Malnutrition can slow the metabolism, impact bone density and even lead to cardiac arrest. Trujillo says that with the right treatment, people can also recover fully. ""But the brain needs time, food, therapy and compassion to heal,"" she says. Trujillo is the president of the International Association of Eating Disorder Professionals . She is also a co-founder of Comenzar de Nuevo , a leading treatment facility in Latin America, where patients of all ages and walks of life can get support and skill-build as they recover. For Friedman, recovery also includes advocating for other teens struggling with eating disorders and other mental health conditions. She started a mental health and wellness podcast called Balancing Act . ""As I was digging myself out of this hole, I realized that I wanted to help other people who felt like they had been battling with this alone,"" she says. ""Because I knew what it was like to struggle alone."" For more resources and support, check out the National Eating Disorders Association . Want us to cover more mental health topics?

health,"Anopheles mosquito, Culicidae. De Agostini Editorial/via Getty Images hide caption Each year, 263 million people get malaria. But from the parasite's perspective, infecting humans is harder than you might think, and requires completing an epic journey within the tiny body of a mosquito. First, the mosquito must suck the blood of an individual infected with malaria — bringing the Plasmodium parasite into the insect's gut. Then the parasite must travel to the critter's salivary glands, where it's poised to be injected into the mosquito's next victim via a bite. Now a team of researchers have found a way to interrupt this crucial journey. By using gene editing to make a tiny tweak to the mosquito's genome — one that changes just a single amino acid — parasites were largely prevented from reaching their final destination. The change effectively rendered laboratory mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria , researchers report Wednesday in Nature. ""The idea that you could change just one amino acid and not have the parasite transmitted is a pretty big deal,"" says Fred Gould , an entomologist at North Carolina State University who wasn't involved in the study. ""It's really exciting."" That tiny tweak could be spread through a whole mosquito population using a gene drive, a genetic technology that breaks the normal 50-50 rules of inheritance. Gene drives are sequences of DNA that can be inserted into the genome of an individual and cause a specific mutation or gene to be passed on to virtually all offspring, instead of just 50%. Eventually, researchers hope to engineer mosquitoes with this approach and release them into the wild. ""These mosquitoes will spread on their own and gradually transform the malaria-transmitting mosquito population to one that cannot transmit malaria,"" says George Dimopoulos , a biologist at Johns Hopkins University and study co-author. Dimopoulos isn't claiming this technique will be the final nail in malaria's coffin, and it's far from being ready for release. It'll likely be several years, at least, before field tests, and will require buy-in and approval by local communities and governments. But he argues new genetic tools are needed to quash the disease, since existing ones like bed nets and antimalarial drugs haven't been able to turn malaria — which kills 600,000 a year — into a disease of the past. But gene drive technology is controversial. ""Gene drives could have far-reaching, unpredictable negative consequences,"" says Dana Perls , senior program manager on emerging technologies at Friends of the Earth, an environmental non-profit. Because they distort normal patterns of inheritance, ""the genetic changes from a gene drive to a population of mosquitoes are very likely to persist for a long time, possibly permanently."" Critics worry that gene drives designed to spread one tiny change to the genome could end up mutating to affect other parts of the genome. That could result in unanticipated changes spreading fast through a population before researchers would have a chance to stop it, potentially upending the delicate balance of an ecosystem. Still, researchers are exploring several gene editing strategies. Some aim to suppress mosquito populations by rendering individuals infertile. But there are worries that wiping out mosquitoes could have unintended consequences for ecosystems — for example by removing a food source for birds and bats. Another strategy is to engineer mosquitoes with new genes that would make proteins that mess with the parasite itself, curbing transmission without harming the bugs. Dimopoulos and his colleagues wanted to take a different approach, one that messed with the parasite, but without adding an entirely new gene. They settled on a gene called FREP1 . It helps mosquitoes feed on blood. But it also appears to be important to the parasites, which use it to complete their crucial journey to the salivary glands in ways researchers don't fully understand. Some mosquitoes have a small genetic change that seems to disrupt this journey. The researchers used CRISPR, a gene editing technology that can very precisely change the genome, to create two nearly-identical Anopheles stephensi groups, one with the normal FREP1 gene and one with the variant. The variant is very small, changing just one amino acid, the basic building blocks of proteins. But that small change had big effects. Mosquitoes with the edited variant have about 5 times fewer infective parasites in the salivary glands, a median of zero compared with thousands in non-edited mosquitoes. There were significantly fewer parasites in the gut, too. Otherwise, the insects appeared perfectly healthy. It's unclear exactly how much this genetic tweak would impair a mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. But previous research suggests ""something on the order of a 90% reduction in malaria transmission would be more or less what you'd expect,"" says Ethan Bier , a geneticist at the University of California San Diego and study co-author. ""I was surprised myself that a single amino acid change could do that."" Next, the researchers showed that they could rapidly spread this beneficial change with a gene drive. It took just 10 generations for the variant to spread to over 90% of their laboratory population. ""It's really excellent work,"" says Anthony James , a molecular biologist at the University of California Irvine who wasn't involved in the study, but works on introducing new resistance genes to mosquitoes. Since the change is naturally occurring, he says it could be ""marginally more acceptable"" to people wary of genetic engineering. ""It's good to have more than one approach available,"" he says. That's especially important if the malaria parasite evolves resistance against these new tools."

climate,"What remains of the ""Tree of Life"" on Sunday, July 20, 2025, is visible off the coast of Efate Island, Vanuatu, after being toppled by cyclones in 2023 and further damaged by an earthquake in 2024. Annika Hammerschlag/AP hide caption THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The UN's highest court is handing down a historic opinion on climate change Wednesday, a decision that could set a legal benchmark for action around the globe to the climate crisis. After years of lobbying by vulnerable island nations who fear they could disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice in 2023 for an advisory opinion, a non-binding but important basis for international obligations. A panel of 15 judges was tasked with answering two questions. First, what are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? Second, what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? ""The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,"" Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney general of the island nation of Vanuatu, told the court during a week of hearings in December. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis but it affects many more island nations in the South Pacific. ""The agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough,"" Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister for climate change, told The Associated Press. Any decision by The Hague-based court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol, since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. ""What makes this case so important is that it addresses the past, present, and future of climate action. It's not just about future targets -- it also tackles historical responsibility, because we cannot solve the climate crisis without confronting its roots,"" Joie Chowdhury, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, told AP. Activists could bring lawsuits against their own countries for failing to comply with the decision and states could return to the International Court of Justice to hold each other to account. And whatever the judges say will be used as the basis for other legal instruments, like investment agreements, Chowdhury said. The United States and Russia, both of whom are major petroleum-producing states, are staunchly opposed to the court mandating emissions reductions. Simply having the court issue an opinion is the latest in a series of legal victories for the small island nations. Earlier this month, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found that countries have a legal duty not only to avoid environmental harm but also to protect and restore ecosystems. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change. In 2019, the Netherlands' Supreme court handed down the first major legal win for climate activists when judges ruled that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change was a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens."
