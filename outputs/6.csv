politics,"President Trump meets with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Oval Office at the White House on July 22. During a question-and-answer session with reporters while at the meeting, Trump railed against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption The Justice Department on Tuesday said it is in touch with an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , to try to arrange a meeting with her in the coming days. President Trump said he thought the development ""sounds appropriate,"" though he also claimed to know nothing about it. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the plan on social media, saying that the department is seeking any information from Maxwell — who is serving time for sex trafficking — as part of its quest to uncover ""all credible evidence"" in the Epstein case. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, is facing a backlash from supporters who want more information released about the disgraced financier's crimes and his 2019 death by suicide in prison. Trump has dismissed the uproar as a politically driven ""witch hunt"" distracting from his agenda. Asked about the newest development on Tuesday, he told reporters, ""I don't really follow that too much."" His comments to reporters came while he was meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines on trade issues. After the meeting, Trump announced on social media that importers of goods from the Philippines will face a 19% tariff , while U.S. exports to the country will face no tariffs. Trump spent most of his time in the Oval Office question-and-answer session railing against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, recently published materials that she claims show that Obama officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ""It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. So you ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,"" Trump told reporters — the ""nonsense"" referring to the Epstein controversy. Trump said it was ""time to go after people"" in connection to his allegations about the 2016 election. Obama's office issued a rare response, calling Trump's statements ""outrageous"" and noting that conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election had been widely accepted. ""These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in the statement. Republicans in Congress have also been grappling with the Epstein issue. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced Tuesday that the House would finish work a day early, canceling votes scheduled for later in the week. That means members will leave town for an annual August recess without a fresh confrontation over Epstein. The schedule change was announced after repeated clashes among Republicans about the files, including a deadlock in the powerful House Rules Committee over an effort by Democrats to force additional votes on the Epstein matter. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales contributed to this report."
politics,"There is an ongoing staffing crunch at the Social Security Administration. Here is one of the agency's field offices, on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption The Social Security Administration (SSA) recently reassigned a small share of its field office employees in an effort to bring down lengthy wait times for the agency's national 800 phone number. Workers at local offices across the country say these reassignments have been disruptive for staff and are increasing wait times for other services. Experts say the tradeoff is a byproduct of a declining Social Security workforce dealing with thousands more Americans who qualify for benefits every day. Thousands of employees have left the government agency in recent months. ""They are in a deep hole of their own creation on staffing and so you just don't have enough people to go around to serve the public,"" said Kathleen Romig, a former SSA official who's now director of Social Security and disability policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). ""And so all you can really do at this point is rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic."" Earlier this month, about 4% of front-line workers were temporarily reassigned to cover the national 800 number, according to the SSA, which added that phone service has improved as a result. ""Thanks to a new telephone platform, most callers are now served quickly through callbacks or automated options, and answer times have already improved significantly in field offices,"" the agency said in a statement to NPR. ""By temporarily assigning a small percentage of field office staff to assist with 800 number calls, we can improve the 800 [number] average speed of answer without disrupting local services."" But Nicole Morio, a field office worker in Staten Island and union representative, said these reassignments have forced front-line staff to take on more work. ""The stress level is probably at a maximum for everyone,"" Morio said. ""At one point I think we were doing the work of 1.8 people. Now it seems as though we're doing the work of 10 to 15."" Monique Buchanan, president of an American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) chapter that represents teleservice center workers, told NPR that the agency has also started to reassign vital claims specialists to the 800 number. Buchanan, who works at a field office in Detroit, said temporarily removing claims specialists from front-line positions is ""directly harmful to the public."" She said these workers finalize applications for people seeking help accessing benefits, such as payments for disabled children. ""These applications are taken through an interview that the claim specialist engages in,"" she said. ""So, the start is the interview with the claims specialist."" CBPP's Romig said staffing up the national hotline might not actually be faster for beneficiaries because so much work is done by claim specialists and other staff at field offices. ""Often customers can't actually complete their business on the phone,"" she said. ""They are going to have to end up in a field office ultimately anyway, or a field office employee is going to have to process that claim that has been taken on the phone or resolve the problem that has been raised on the phone."" The agency recently touted that it had reduced the average answering speed on the 800 number to ""13 minutes, a 35 percent reduction compared to this time last year and over a 50 percent reduction compared to last year's annual average."" But experts say it's harder to track whether the agency is doing better in other metrics. Recently the agency took down various real-time metrics from its website. Romig said it's possible wait times are decreasing as more people are transferred to 800-number duty, but it will surely come at the expense of other vital services. ""Sure, you can get a boost in a particular metric like phone hold times by making a massive shift of staffers to answer the phones,"" she said. ""But you do that by creating a new hole in the field offices, and that's what they're doing."" A Social Security Administration office on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption Morio, the Staten Island employee, believes she and other field office workers are being ""prevented"" from properly serving the people who need their help. ""We can't complete all of the things that need to be done,"" she said. ""When you have so little employees and so much work — it's stressful because we get hired to help the claimants. We get hired to help the American public. We're public servants. That's what we do."" Policy experts and front-line workers say that lowering wait times for phone services is a worthy goal, but it cannot be achieved without hiring more staff. Romig said staffing levels at Social Security were already at a decades-long low before the Trump administration began urging people to resign or retire early. According to agency officials, roughly 4,600 employees have left since March. Romig cautioned that staffing ""numbers are very hard to pin down"" because resignations are constantly ""in flux,"" due to the administration's deferred resignation program and ongoing early retirements. During a congressional hearing last month, new SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano told members he does not believe increasing staffing is necessary to improve the agency's services. ""I do agree we must perform significantly better,"" he said, ""but increased staffing is not the long-term solution."" But Jessica LaPointe, who works at a field office in Madison, Wis., and is the president of the local AFGE chapter that represents 25,000 field office workers, said the shuffling of staffing is prompting even more people to leave the agency. ""If they decided not to take the buyout incentives that were offered in March, then now they're just leaving to save their mental health as their work keeps piling up,"" LaPointe said. ""It really is a manufactured crisis as a result of past changes that just continue to just make everything worse, sadly."" Some local field offices only have a few employees, so the loss of one can have a big impact. Juan Daniel Vasquez, who is a generalist technical expert in a field office in Monroe, Mich., said his office had an employee who covered the phones who was recently shifted to the 800 number. He said that since then, all the staff have been tasked with covering the phones, which has added a significant amount of work to everyone's plate. ""It's a lot tougher,"" Vasquez said. ""I'm nearing retirement age and … if you had asked me last year, I would have said I want to stay another five to seven years. Now I'm looking at one to two."" The agency told NPR that Bisignano has been ""visiting field offices and processing centers to hear directly from front-line employees,"" since his confirmation hearing. ""He is committed to giving SSA employees the tools they need to provide best-in-class customer service to the American public and succeed in their roles,"" the agency said in a statement. ""SSA monitors all workload measures in the field offices that are helping answer the 800 Number calls. In addition, we have established field office support units to assist with critical workloads and demands."" But LaPointe said that working conditions for field office workers in the past few months have only gotten worse. ""There's no indication that this is getting better,"" she said. ""We have an agency not listening to the workers."""
politics,"The seal of the Department of Defense at the Pentagon. Mark Wilson/Getty Images hide caption The Department of Homeland Security is preparing to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants who entered the country illegally, as well as to increase the number of immigrants detained at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, according to correspondence between DHS and the Pentagon obtained by NPR. According to the letter, dated July 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the moves, which were requested by DHS the previous month. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, had sought immediate access to Camp Atterbury, a National Guard base in Indiana, and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, a base in New Jersey, from the Defense Department. ICE is also seeking to detain more immigrants without legal status at Guantánamo Bay prior to their final removal from the United States. ""DoD approves this support through September 30, 2025, subject to ICE maintaining a 24/7 oversight presence at each site to maintain custody and provide overall supervision of each site,"" stated the letter from Executive Secretary Anthony Fuscellaro to DHS acting Executive Secretary Andrew Whitaker. ICE staff and contractors will be responsible for all care and handling of the migrants, including meals, medical screening, transportation and medical services, according to the correspondence obtained by NPR. Neither DHS nor the Defense Department has yet responded to questions about the letter. On his first day in office, President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, enabling DHS to gain access to DOD's military resources. During congressional testimony, Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, told lawmakers he did not expect DHS to repay the Pentagon for their costs. The approval letter notes that DHS will pay DOD for any costs associated with migrant detention at McGuire Field, the Air Force base in New Jersey. The request for the use of additional military bases, and expansion at Guantánamo, comes as the Trump administration has pushed to arrest and detain more people in the country without legal status. DHS has nearly 57,000 people in immigration detention, though it only has about 41,000 beds . The department has sought out contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, local jurisdictions, and the use of military bases to detain migrants. By June, Guantánamo was holding about 500 migrants , though until now the base could only accommodate about 200 . In the letter to lawmakers obtained by NPR, Hegseth said that the use of the bases in Indiana and New Jersey for immigration detention ""will not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or other military requirements, including National Guard and Reserve readiness."" Camp Atterbury in Indiana will assist with removal operations out of the Chicago area; McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey will support Newark. Guantánamo Bay is designated to help with detentions and removals from Miami. The plan laid out by DHS calls for space for up to 1,000 people at the Indiana and New Jersey bases and to approximately double the capacity at Guantánamo to 400 people. DOD rejected a request from DHS for air transportation assistance until it got more details. In May, DHS asked for 20,000 National Guard members to assist ICE in its operations ranging from ""night raids"" and ""rural interdictions"" to guard duty at detention facilities. The Pentagon has already approved some 700 guard members to assist in Florida, Louisiana and Texas. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that hundreds more National Guard troops are expected to be called up to assist operations in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia. The Democratic congressional delegation in a statement condemned the terms of the use of the New Jersey base. ""This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources,"" they said in the statement. ""Using our country's military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful."" In addition to using the military, the Trump administration is expected to be able to scale up its detention capacity due to an influx of funding from Congress. The recent tax and spending bill set aside $45 billion for immigration detention centers and $30 billion for more ICE personnel, transportation costs and to maintain existing ICE facilities."

politics,"Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO James Quincey says the company will ""expand our trademark Coca-Cola product range with U.S. cane sugar"" to give Coke fans a new option. President Trump mentioned the plan last week, saying Coca-Cola had ""agreed"" to use real cane sugar, similar to its recipe for Mexican Coke. Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption Coke drinkers who want to avoid corn syrup sometimes opt for Mexican Coke, which is made with cane sugar. But the drink's U.S. fans will have a new option later this year. ""We're going to be bringing a Coke sweetened with U.S. cane sugar into the market this fall,"" Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO James Quincey said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday. The company announced the change in the quarterly earnings report it released Tuesday, describing the new drink as an expansion of its product line. Quincey said the new offering would ""complement"" Coca-Cola's core portfolio of drinks, suggesting it could arrive as an alternative, rather than a replacement, for its flagship Coke product. Coca-Cola's move comes a week after the White House issued a statement by President Trump saying he had been talking to the soft drink giant about using cane sugar rather than high-fructose corn syrup in its signature drink. ""I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You'll see. It's just better!"" Trump said. Trump is a noted fan of Diet Coke, a product line that is mainly sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame . The president's involvement in the recipe of a popular drink was noted in Tuesday's call, but officials did not go into detail about what, if any, communications they had with the White House. ""As you may have seen last week, we appreciate the president's enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand,"" Quincey said. When asked whether he and Trump had discussed the idea of using cane sugar in Coke, the CEO replied in part, ""engagement with government is a piece of what goes on."" The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment on whether the Trump administration had contacted the company about cane sugar. The use of domestic sugar aligns with Trump's economic priorities, as he has imposed steep tariffs on dozens of foreign nations. The source of the sugar could also affect the drink's cost: The U.S. sugar industry enjoys substantial market protections against foreign rivals. ""The U.S. has high trade barriers against imported sugar,"" as NPR's Scott Horsley has reported . ""As a result, the price of sugar in this country is usually about twice what it is on the world market."" While some U.S. consumers see Mexican Coke as a unique Coca-Cola product that uses cane sugar, Quincey noted that the company already uses the sweetener in several drinks. ""Actually, we use cane sugar in a number of our other brands in the U.S. portfolio, from lemonade to teas, some of the coffee stuff, some of the Vitamin Water drinks,"" he said. But, he added, Coca-Cola wants to explore new options to suit consumer preferences. Trump's push for cane sugar over corn syrup has not gone over well with the U.S. corn industry. Corn Refiners Association President and CEO John Bode predicts that an increase in using U.S. cane sugar will lead to a rise in foreign cane sugar imports. Bode said in a statement to NPR, ""Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and expand the trade deficit."" While President Trump famously adores Diet Coke , cane sugar has emerged as a popular issue for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a key proponent of the administration's Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, movement. ""MAHA is winning,"" Kennedy tweeted last month , applauding the Steak 'n Shake restaurant chain's move to ""offer Coca-Cola with real cane sugar in glass bottles."" But just three months ago, Kennedy said that in the U.S., sugar ""is poisoning us."" And in March, Kennedy hailed West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey for seeking ""a SNAP waiver to get sodas and other sugar drinks off of food stamps."" While he has spoken out against sugar , Kennedy has acknowledged that the government isn't likely to be able to remove it from Americans' diets. He has also condemned the use of additives such as high-fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes and artificial flavors in food. High-fructose corn syrup has been a regular target of health experts for years, thanks to its ubiquity in sweet drinks and processed foods. ""In 2004, a widely read report suggested high fructose corn syrup was a major cause of the obesity epidemic, and documentaries such as Fast Food Nation and King Corn piled on,"" as NPR reported in 2012 , noting that despite the report being recanted by its authors, the idea took hold. But whether sugar or syrup are used to sweeten food and drinks, the potential health risks for American consumers are virtually the same, according to David M. Klurfeld, an adjunct professor in the Department of Applied Health Science at the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington. ""There is overwhelming evidence that cane or beet sugar have almost no difference from HFCS [high fructose corn syrup] in composition and no difference in any health effects,"" Klurfeld tells NPR. High-fructose corn syrup and table sugar have fairly similar proportions of glucose and fructose, he says, adding that when sugar is added to soft drinks with acidic pH levels, their chemical compositions become even more alike. ""The data linking HFCS with obesity or any adverse health effect are observational epidemiology,"" Klurfeld says. ""This cannot prove cause and effect because of confounding variables — people who drink the most soda are heavier, exercise less, have different diets, etc."" But, he adds, ""Randomized controlled studies comparing sugar and HFCS for effects on blood glucose, lipids, or weight loss have all show no differences."" NPR's Scott Neuman contributed to this report."
politics,"Rep. Ritchie Torres (right), D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill July 17, 2023 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America hide caption The Republican-controlled Texas legislature is looking to redraw congressional maps to give the GOP an edge in next year's midterm elections — and New York Rep. Ritchie Torres says Democrats have no choice but to fight back. ""To just simply stand by passively and allow Republicans to rig the process in their favor is actually a form of complicity. It's the opposite of protecting democracy,"" Torres told Morning Edition . With Texas still reeling from the deadly July 4 floods, the state legislature plans to approve a partisan redistricting of Texas' congressional map . The move is driven by President Trump's desire to win five more seats for Republicans next fall. Some Democrats want states where their party is in control to redraw their House district lines and cancel out Texas' plans or gain their own advantage. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is one of the Democrats who's expressed this interest, and during a press conference last week he said, ""I'm not going to be passive at this moment."" Torres says this scenario ""underscores the need for a national system in which we take the politics out of redistricting."" ""Republicans should be careful what they wish for,"" he said. ""The Republicans in Texas have the intention of strengthening the Republican seats, but could have the effect of weakening them in a climate that is likely to be more favorable to Democrats."" NPR's Steve Inskeep and Torres further discussed the Republican Party's redistricting agenda and why he believes the Democratic Party must ""counter their cheating or become complicit."" The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Steve Inskeep : What's the basic idea you're promoting? Rep. Ritchie Torres : Well, I would describe it not as ruthlessness, but as fairness. In an ideal world, there would only be a redistricting at the beginning of the decade at the decennial census. You know, no one in the Democratic Party wants a redistricting arms race. But if Republicans are going to rewrite the rules in the middle of the game and redraw maps in Texas, which could yield up to five seats, then we have no choice but to respond and reciprocate. To stand by passively would mean unilateral disarmament. Inskeep : Can you do that in New York? Torres : It's theoretically possible, but, you know, we face constraints in New York. Inskeep : There's a constitutional provision in New York. Torres : There's constitutional provision that might be lacking in Texas, but we have no choice but to try, because Republicans are essentially cheating or essentially rewriting the rules in the middle of the game. And either we counter their cheating or we become complicit. Inskeep : You're saying that you would like your state's leaders even in New York, despite the constitutional provisions, to try to find some way around them and see if you can get a different electoral map. Torres : We should attempt to redraw maps in a fair manner within the constraints of the Constitution. Yes. Inskeep : People watching this from the outside are perhaps thinking, 'We're being manipulated here. All the same votes, and you slice us up in different ways and come up with a different result.' Torres : Look, I think it underscores the need for a national system in which we take the politics out of redistricting. Democrats are in favor. We've passed legislation in every legislative session where we were in the majority, only to have it obstructed and opposed by the Republicans. But if one side is playing by the rules and the other side is pursuing power at all cost, that's a losing proposition for the Democratic Party. And it's a losing proposition for democracy. Inskeep : There are a number of different purposes that you can serve with redistricting, and one of them is maximizing the number of seats your party gets. But another is incumbent protection, which, as I understand, is more common in redistricting. The party in power will protect their seats, and you have fewer and fewer seats that are truly in play anywhere in Congress. How do you think that has affected the business that the House of Representatives does that you're in? Torres : Well, the principle that govern the original Texas redistricting was incumbency protection. And Republicans should be careful what they wish for. The Republicans in Texas have the intention of strengthening the Republican seats, but could have the effect of weakening them in a climate that is likely to be more favorable to Democrats. Inskeep : I guess we should explain the math. Instead of X number of seats that are 60% Republican, you have more seats that are 52% Republican. So they might lose one. Torres : And those seats could easily become more competitive, like Jared Golden in Maine, who has said, ""Be careful what you wish for,"" because he is a Democrat who won in a Trump district. Inskeep : What do you think about as you hear Democrats being described, even six months into the Trump presidency, as being confused, in disarray, still trying to figure out their loss in 2024, still trying to figure out a message for 2026 and beyond. Torres : I think the Democratic Party is a work in progress. We have a message which is affordability, to focus like a laser on lowering the cost of living, which was the dominant issue in the New York City mayor's race. But look, we're facing an unprecedented challenge to our economy, our democracy, our society. I mean, Donald Trump has no regard for the rules and norms of democracy. And so there's no formula for the kind of resistance that we're mounting against Trump 2.0, which is far more vindictive, far more aggressive, far more emboldened than anything we've seen before, including Trump 1.0. Inskeep : Do you think that there has been a problem in finding a new generation of leaders for the Democratic Party? Torres : I think a new generation of leadership is emerging. There are younger members who are assuming committee chairmanships like Robert Garcia [D-Calif.] for Oversight or Angie Craig [D-Minn.] for Agriculture. So the new guard is rising, and we have a new generation of members of Congress who are adapting to the world of new media. You know, as Democrats, if we have confidence in our message, we have to be willing to take that message to every corner of the alternative media ecosystem. And that's something we're starting to do. Inskeep: Is that something that Republicans did better in the last election? Torres : I think Donald Trump is one of the masters of alternative media. And for a long time, we're playing catch up.

science,"Newborn babies lie in bassinets in the nursery of a postpartum recovery center in upstate New York in 2017. A new study examined births over decades to find tendencies toward having all girls or all boys. Seth Wenig/AP hide caption Couples who've been surprised by a string of baby boys or baby girls could be forgiven for wondering whether the odds in the offspring lottery are more than just pure chance. A new study by Harvard University researchers that examines the birthing records of 58,007 women suggests their hunch might be correct. The authors of the study, published in the journal Science Advances last week , found that instead of straight 50/50 odds between boys and girls with each birth, the offspring in families with at least three children tend to follow what scientists call a ""weighted coin toss,"" indicating that each family may have a distinct tendency toward girls or boys. ""We're seeing a lot of us having only boys or girls,"" says Siwen Wang, a doctoral student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the lead author in the study. That led her and colleagues to wonder ""whether it's simply by chance, or is there any underlying biology explaining these sex clustering within families?"" They analyzed data from the second and third iteration of the Nurses' Health Study , which tracked just over 146,000 pregnancies across the U.S. from 1956 to 2015. They found that if the first two children born in a family are girls, the chances of the third child also being a girl are higher than for a boy — and this pattern continues with subsequent children. The same holds true if the first two are boys: The likelihood of having another boy increases, and the trend persists through later births. ""Notably, in families with three boys (MMM), the probability of having another boy was 61%; in families with three girls (FFF), the probability of having another girl was 58%,"" the study authors wrote. Looking for a possible explanation, ""one of the things that stands out is age at first birth — that's associated with a moderately higher chance of having only boys or girls,"" Wang says. ""If you're starting your family younger than 23 ... [there is] around a 40% chance of having a same-sex family,"" she says. If the woman begins having children after age 28, it's around 50% — a relatively small but statistically significant difference. The researchers excluded families with only one child and pregnancies ending in miscarriage, stillbirth or twins. Women with a history of infertility treatments were also left out of the study. To avoid bias from parents who stopped having children after reaching a preferred sex ratio, the researchers did not count each woman's final birth in the analysis. The researchers speculate that in older women, shorter menstrual cycles could factor into the results and that changes in vaginal acidity might favor the survival of sperm carrying either the Y (boys) or X (girls) chromosome. However, they note that because maternal and paternal ages are often correlated, the father's age might also play a role. Since the study included only women, the authors emphasize that the exact mechanism remains uncertain. ""We don't have data about the dad,"" Wang says. ""We don't have data about his genetics or even very precise characteristics ... which is obviously important for sex determination."" It's a concern also raised by Mark Gerstein, a professor at Yale University who wasn't involved in the research. Gerstein specializes in applying computational approaches to molecular biology. ""Given the disparity observed for mothers in the study, one could easily envision an equally impactful relationship with either the genetics or age of the father,"" he says. ""This seems like a promising area for future research to explore."" Ralph Catalano, an emeritus professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, who also wasn't involved in the research, thinks that the study's narrow focus on sex at birth may not show the full picture. ""Fewer than 50% of conceptions reach birth. More than 50% are spontaneously aborted [miscarried], and that's not a random draw,"" he says. Due to immunological and developmental sensitivity, females are more likely to be spontaneously aborted early in pregnancy, while males are more vulnerable to spontaneous abortion later in pregnancy because they are physically frailer, he says. ""The sex of infants we see — those who make it to birth — is shaped as much by in utero selection as by sex at conception,"" he says. Another caveat is the composition of the sample. The Nurses' Health Study that the sample was drawn from is made up of overwhelmingly white women residing in the United States. ""Since sex preferences and reproductive behaviors vary across cultures, religions, or countries … the sex ratio distribution pattern observed in our study may not apply to other societies,"" the researchers acknowledge."
science,"Tiny variations in the weather, tides and even the liquid inside the Earth's core can affect the length of the day. NASA hide caption If today feels like it's flying by, you can blame it on our spinning planet: A group of scientists tracking Earth's rotation predicts that the day will be a fraction of a second shorter than normal. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service , which measures the Earth's rotation and forecasts the length of the day, has predicted that July 22 could come out about a millisecond short of a standard 24-hour spin. Variations in the Earth's rotation are not uncommon: On July 9, for example, the Earth's quick spin shortened the day by nearly 1.4 milliseconds. But recent headlines from all over the world have been hyping ""freakishly short"" days in July and August. Scientific experts who constantly monitor the Earth's rotation seem a bit baffled and amused that a few slightly more-speedy-than-normal spins this summer have captured the public's imagination. ""We've known about the rotation of the Earth being variable for about a hundred years,"" says Dennis McCarthy, the former director of time at the U.S. Naval Observatory. ""This is just one of those little variations that comes along."" McCarthy, who's literally written the book on time and Earth's rotation, says the speed of the planet's spin gets influenced by all kinds of factors: the gravitational influence of the moon, the effect of winds and the atmosphere, plus the movements of the Earth's liquid core. Good data on the Earth's rotation goes back thousands of years, thanks to observations of solar eclipses in China. These days, researchers around the world track the spinning of the globe by pointing radio telescopes at quasars, incredibly luminous cores of distant galaxies that are so far away, they act as fixed points in space. That kind of data, plus information from GPS systems, all gets sent to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, which uses it to forecast the day length. Predictions are also made by others, such as the U.S. Naval Observatory. Generally speaking, over millions of years, the Earth's rotation has been slowing down, a trend that's expected to continue into the future, says McCarthy. The main reason is the moon. The moon's gravitational pull on the Earth creates ocean tides, and a process called ""tidal braking"" gradually slows the Earth's spin. ""We know it's slowing down, because we have a real good idea of the effect of the moon,"" says McCarthy. ""Although that slowing down is continuing, there are departures from that general pattern."" Specifically, over the last decade or so, there's been a bumper crop of days that are somewhat short. Last year's shortest day, July 5, 2024, was 1.65 milliseconds shorter than the usual 86,400 seconds, says Thomas Herring , a geophysicist with MIT. He says that was the shortest day since the 1950s, which is when researchers started comparing the rotation of the Earth to the very accurate time standard provided by atomic clocks that measure the regular oscillations of atoms. In the past, the world's timekeepers have occasionally resorted to adding in some ""leap seconds"" — these extra seconds keep atomic time in sync with Earth's rotation as it slows. The last time an extra second was added to the clock was in 2016. The recent speedy spins of the Earth, however, raise the possibility of instituting ""negative leap seconds,"" or basically taking away a second rather than adding one, which is something that's never been done before. ""I think it will be unlikely that a negative leap second will be invoked,"" says Herring, given that regular old leap seconds seem to be falling out of favor. While he and others say that the recent short-duration days are of little significance in and of themselves, understanding and being able to predict the precise rotation of the Earth is important for all kinds of applications—everything from launching missiles to navigation to high-tech farming. At the equator, in one second, the Earth will rotate the length of four football fields, says Nick Stamatakos, head of the Earth orientation department at the U.S. Naval Observatory. ""The Earth's moving pretty fast,"" he says. ""So any little variations will accumulate, and it's an issue."" By looking at the recent rotation history along with information about weather systems and long-term patterns, researchers can make predictions about how the Earth will spin on any given day. These predictions generally get less accurate the farther out they go. While the moon has long been the major player in controlling the speed of the Earth's rotation, one study found that humans are playing a role. Climate change is melting ice at the poles and sending water down to the equator, slowing the rotation down. The researchers believe that this effect is already lengthening the days. Some have calculated that in a worst-case scenario, climate change could eventually redistribute water in a way that would make the days milliseconds longer. That would make humans, rather than the moon, the dominant driver of changes to day length. ""We can really become the dominant drivers of Earth's rotation, due to human-induced climate change,"" says lead researcher Benedikt Soja of ETH Zürich, a university in Switzerland. ""That was really surprising, and really an interesting revelation to us."""

For this week's Sea Camp , we're diving below the surface to explore the sunlight zone, the portion of ocean that's 0-200 meters deep. This is where phytoplankton eat sunlight, poop out sugar and oxygen and kick off the ocean carbon cycle as we know it. Our focus is something arguably even cooler: The ""superpowers"" of some of the zone's spineless inhabitants, like regeneration and super strength. That's what marine biologist Drew Harvell calls the ""biological impossibilities"" of some residents in her new book The Ocean's Menagerie . Throughout the episode, we meet these invertebrates, which includes everything from star fish and sea slugs to jellyfish and sponges.

science,"The United States Environmental Protection Agency building is seen in August 2024 in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration is shutting down the agency's unit for scientific research. Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images hide caption The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to shutter the agency's scientific research arm that provides expertise for environmental policies and regulations, as part of the Trump administration's continuing downsizing of the federal government. The agency is closing the Office of Research and Development , which analyzes dangers posed by a variety of hazards, including toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, indoor air contaminants, water pollution, watershed destruction and drinking water pollutants. The office also manages grant programs that fund universities and private companies. ""Under President Trump's leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while powering the great American comeback,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement announcing the plan Friday. ""This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars."" The cut, part of a plan to cut 23% of the EPA's staff, will save $748.8 million, according to the agency. It said the EPA would at the same time add ""laboratory functions and hundreds of scientific, technical, bioinformatic, and information technology experts to EPA's air, water, and chemical offices on top of the thousands of scientists and engineers employed by EPA within those program offices."" In addition, the agency is moving ahead with a plan to create a new ""Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions,"" the EPA says. That new office ""will allow EPA to prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,"" according to the agency. The EPA said in a statement to NPR that some employees were being reassigned and that no employees have been laid off yet, but 'that is the next step in the process.'"" Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the ranking member on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, condemned the cuts. ""Administrator Zeldin has finally confirmed what he has denied for months and months — the destruction of the Office of Research and Development,"" she said in a statement . ""The Trump Administration is firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people. The obliteration of ORD will have generational impacts on Americans' health and safety. This is a travesty."" Kyla Bennett, director of science policy for the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ), said eliminating the ORD ""will not only cripple EPA's ability to do its own research, but also to apply the research of other scientists. This [reduction in force], together with the slashing of travel and training budgets, will leave EPA flying blind and unable to use the best available science. These short-sighted cuts will ultimately affect every American, and it is despicable."" The American Chemistry Council , which represents chemical manufacturers, said the organization ""supports EPA evaluating its resources to ensure American taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively to meet the Agency's statutory requirements. If necessary, that includes shifting resources from certain offices."" In January, the agency had 16,155 employees, but has reduced that number to 12,448, the EPA says. The agency has also eliminated the EPA's Environmental Justice and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion arms among other cuts."
health,"Sonya Sotinsky sits at Crane Cove Park in San Francisco on March 25. Sotinsky was diagnosed with Stage 4 tongue cancer and underwent surgery to remove her tongue, larynx and other structures. She then worked with researchers to create an AI-generated voice using past recordings of her speech. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption When doctors told her they had to remove her tongue and voice box to save her life from the cancer that had invaded her mouth, Sonya Sotinsky sat down with a microphone to record herself saying the things she would never again be able to say. This story was produced in partnership with KFF Health News . ""Happy birthday"" and ""I'm proud of you"" topped the phrases she banked for her husband and two daughters, as well as ""I'll be right with you,"" intended for customers at the architecture firm she co-owns in Tucson, Arizona. Thinking about the grandchildren she desperately hoped to see born one day, she also recorded herself reading more than a dozen children's books, from Eloise to Dr. Seuss, to one day play for them at bedtime. But one of the biggest categories of sound files she banked was a string of curse words and filthy sayings. If the voice is the primary expression of personality, sarcasm and profanity are essential to Sotinsky's. ""When you can't use your voice, it is very, very frustrating. Other people project what they think your personality is. I have silently screamed and screamed at there being no scream,"" said Sotinsky in a recent interview, referring to rudimentary voice technology or writing notes by hand. ""What the literal you-know-what?"" Fighting invasive oral cancer at age 51 forced Sotinsky to confront the existential importance of the human voice. Her unique intonation, cadence and slight New Jersey accent, she felt, were fingerprints of her identity. And she refused to be silenced. Sonya Sotinsky uses an app on her phone to talk with her daughter Ela Fuentevilla at Crane Cove Park in San Francisco on March 25. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption While her doctors and insurance company saved her life, they showed little interest in saving her voice, she said. So she set out on her own to research and identify the artificial intelligence company that could. It used the recordings Sotinsky banked of her natural voice to build an exact replica now stored in an app on her phone, allowing her to type and speak once again with a full range of sentiment and sarcasm. ""She got her sass back,"" said Sotinsky's daughter, Ela Fuentevilla, 23. ""When we heard her AI voice, we all cried, my sister, my dad and I. It's crazy similar."" It took close to a year for doctors to catch Sotinsky's cancer. She complained to her orthodontist and dentist multiple times about jaw pain and a strange sensation under her tongue. Then water began dribbling down her chin when she drank. When the pain got so intense she could no longer speak at the end of each day, Sotinsky insisted her orthodontist take a closer look. ""A shadow cast over his face. I saw it when he leaned back,"" she said, ""that look you don't want to see."" That's when she started recording. In the five weeks between her diagnosis and surgery to remove her entire tongue and voice box – in medical terms, a total glossectomy and laryngectomy – she banked as much of her voice as she could manage. ""Your voice is your identity,"" said Dr. Sue Yom , a radiation oncologist at UC-San Francisco, where Sotinsky got treatment. ""Communication is not only how we express ourselves and relate to other people, but also how we make sense of the world."" ""When the voice is no longer available, you can't hear yourself thinking out loud, you can't hear yourself interacting with other people,"" Yom said. ""It impacts how your mind works."" People who lose their voice box, she added, are at higher risk for long-term emotional distress , depression and physical pain compared with those who retain it after cancer treatment. Close to a third lose their job , and the social isolation can be profound. Most laryngectomy patients learn to speak again with an electrolarynx , a small battery-operated box held against the throat that produces a monotonic, mechanical voice. But without a tongue to shape her words, Sotinsky knew that wouldn't work for her. Dr. Sue Yom, a radiation oncologist, stands with a radiotherapy system used to deliver precise, high-dose radiation treatments for cancer patients at the University of California San Francisco's Mission Bay medical center on May 16. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption When Sotinsky had her surgery in January 2022, AI voices were still in their infancy. The best technology she could find yielded a synthetic version of her voice, but it was still flat and robotic, and others strained to understand her. She got by until mid-2024, when she read about tech companies using generative AI to replicate a person's full range of natural inflection and emotion. While companies can now recreate a person's voice from snippets of old home movies or even a one-minute voicemail, 30 minutes is the sweet spot. Sotinsky had banked hours in her children's book readings. ""Eloise saved my voice,"" Sotinsky said. Now she types what she wants to say into a text-to-speech app on her phone, called Whisper , which translates and broadcasts her AI voice through portable speakers. Sonya Sotinsky often uses a portable keyboard to talk using the text-to-speech software on her phone. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption Most doctors and speech therapists who work with head and neck cancer patients don't realize AI software can be used this way, Yom said, and with their focus on saving lives they often don't have the bandwidth to encourage patients to record their voices before they lose them in surgery. Health insurance companies likewise prioritize treatments that extend life over those that improve its quality — and typically avoid covering new technologies until data proves their actuarial value. Sotinsky and her daughter spent months wrangling with claims adjusters at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona , but the insurer refused to reimburse Sotinsky for the $3,000 she spent on her initial assistive speaking technology. ""Apparently, having a voice is not considered a medical necessity,"" Sotinsky quipped, her AI voice edged with sarcasm. Sotinsky now pays the $99 monthly fee for her AI voice clone out of pocket. ""While health plans cover both routine and life-saving care, assistive communication devices are typically not covered,"" said Teresa Joseph , a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. ""As AI provides opportunities to impact health, we imagine that coverage criteria will evolve nationally."" Sotinsky resolved to use her newfound voice to help others regain theirs. She stepped back from her work in architecture and built two websites detailing her voice banking journey — voicebanknow.com and glossectomygirl.com . She tells her story at conferences and webinars, including an oncology conference in Denver that Yom organized for 80 scientists. One doctor who attended, Jennifer De Los Santos , was so inspired by hearing Sotinsky's voice that she began laying the groundwork for a clinical trial on the impact AI technology has on patients' communication and quality of life. That type of research could generate the data health insurers need to measure actuarial value. ""And therefore justify coverage by insurance,"" said De Los Santos, a head and neck cancer researcher and professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Breast cancer survivors faced a similar battle in the 1980s and '90s, she added. Insurers initially refused to cover the cost of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, calling the procedure cosmetic and unnecessary. It took years of patient advocacy and carefully crafted data showing reconstruction had a profound impact on women's physical and emotional well-being before the federal government mandated insurance coverage in 1998. Both De Los Santos and Yom said research data on AI voice clones will likely follow a similar path, eventually proving that a fully functioning, natural-sounding voice can lead to not only a better life, but a longer one. Sonya Sotinsky has built two websites detailing her experience in voice banking and tells her story at conferences, including an oncology conference in Denver for 80 scientists. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption In recent months, Sotinsky's AI voice literally helped save her life. Her cancer had resurged in her lungs and liver. Her voice allowed her to communicate with her doctors and participate fully in developing the treatment plan. It showed her just how ""medically necessary"" having a voice is. She noticed that doctors and nurses took her more seriously. They didn't tune out the way people often did when she relied on her more robotic, synthesized voice. It seemed they saw her as more fully human. ""If someone can only communicate using a few words at a time, and not elaborate and interface more fully, it's natural that you can't detect that they have more depth of thought,"" she said. ""Being able to dialogue with my care team in a more seamless way is vital."" While doctors successfully treated her latest round of cancer, Sotinsky, now 55, said she is confronting her odds in a new way, facing the reality that she will likely die much sooner than she wants. All over again, she realized how crucial her voice is for maintaining perspective on life and a sense of humor in the face of death. ""I tend to forget and think I am fine, when in reality, this is forever now. Emotionally, you start to get cocky again and this was like, 'Whoa, b****, we ain't playing.' This cancer is real,"" Sotinsky said, typing her next phrase with a mischievous grin. ""Sarcasm is part of my love language.""

health,"In Montana, one man says Medicaid and the drug coverage he gets through it are what allow him to work. But a raise he has gotten could mean he loses Medicaid, so he says he decided to ""fudge the numbers."" Oona Zenda/KFF Health News hide caption MISSOULA, Mont. — As congressional Republicans finalized Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, one man who relies on that government-subsidized health coverage was trying to coax his old car to start after an eight-hour shift making sandwiches. James asked that only his middle name be used to tell his story so that he wouldn't lose health coverage or be accused of Medicaid fraud. He found his food service gig a few weeks into an addiction treatment program. The man, who is in his late 30s, said his boss ""hasn't been disappointed."" ""I'm a good worker,"" he said with a grin. James can get the prescription drugs that help him stabilize his life and hold down that job through Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program that covers people with low incomes or disabilities. Those drugs curb his desire for alcohol and treat long-standing conditions that exacerbate his addiction, including bipolar and insomnia disorders. But he hasn't qualified for the program in months, ever since his work hours increased and he received a raise of about $1 an hour. He exceeds his income eligibility limit of about $21,000 per year by roughly $50 a week. James said that despite his raise, he's struggling to cover routine expenses, such as keeping his car running and paying his phone bill. He said he can't afford the care he needs even on the cheapest insurance plan available to him through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace or through his job's health insurance plan. Even paying $60 a month for his sleep medications — one of six prescriptions he takes daily — is too expensive. ""I only saw one option,"" James said. ""Fudge the numbers."" James hasn't reported his new income to the state. That puts him at odds with congressional Republicans who justified adding hurdles to Medicaid by claiming the system is rife with waste, fraud and abuse. But James isn't someone sitting on his couch playing video games, the type of person House Speaker Mike Johnson and others said they would target as they sought to impose work requirements. Medicaid provides health coverage and long-term care to more than 70 million people in the United States. Those who study safety-net systems say it's extremely rare for enrollees to commit fraud to tap into that coverage. In fact, research shows that swaths of eligible people aren't enrolled in Medicaid, likely because the system is so confusing. And nearly two-thirds of people on Medicaid in 2023 had jobs, according to an analysis by KFF , a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Those transitioning off Medicaid may qualify for other subsidized or low-priced health plans through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace. But, as in James' case, such plans can have gaps in what care is covered, and more comprehensive private plans may be too expensive. So James and an unknown number of other people find themselves caught between working too much to qualify for Medicaid but earning too little to pay for their own health care. James considers himself to be a patriot and said that people shouldn't ""use government funding to just be lazy."" He agrees with the Republican argument that, if able, people should work if they receive Medicaid. “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” James Hiding his hours on the job from the government bothers him, especially since he feels he must lie to access the medical care that enables him to work. ""I don't want to be a fraud. I don't want to die,"" James said. ""Those shouldn't be the only two options."" On July 4, Trump signed into law the major tax and spending bill that makes it harder for low-income workers to get Medicaid. That includes requiring beneficiaries to work or go to school and adding paperwork to prove they meet a minimum number of hours on the job every six months. ""It's going to hurt people, whether they're playing by the rules or not,"" said Ben Sommers , a health economist at Harvard University. ""We see this vilification of mostly very hardworking people who are really struggling and are benefiting from a program that helps them stay alive."" James said he initially declined his raise because he worried about losing Medicaid. He had previously been kicked off the coverage about a month into his rehab program after finding work. To stay in the sober-living program he otherwise couldn't afford, James said, he dropped just enough hours at work to requalify for Medicaid and then soon picked up hours again. If he didn't earn more, he said, he had no chance of saving enough money to find housing after graduating from the treatment program. ""They'll give you a bone if you stay in the mud,"" James said. ""But you have to stay there."" That problem — becoming just successful enough to suddenly lose Medicaid — is common. It's called a benefit cliff, said Pamela Herd , who researches government aid at the University of Michigan. ""It just doesn't make any sense that someone gets a dollar pay raise and all of a sudden they lose all access to their health insurance,"" Herd said. She said a partial fix exists called continuous eligibility, which guarantees an individual's Medicaid coverage for a specific period, such as a year or longer. The goal is to give people time to adjust when they do earn more money. Continuous eligibility also helps maintain coverage for low-income workers with unpredictable hours and whose pay changes month to month. But Congress has moved in the other direction. Under the new law, policymakers limited windows of eligibility for able-bodied adults to every six months. That will put more people on the program's eligibility cliff, Herd said, in which they must decide between losing access to coverage or dropping hours at work. ""It is going to be a nightmare,"" Herd said. Those federal changes will be especially difficult for people with chronic conditions, such as James in Montana. Not that long ago, James wouldn't have been breaking the rules to access Medicaid because his state had 12-month continuous eligibility. But in 2023, Montana began requiring enrollees to report any change in their income within 10 days. James is proud of how far he has come. About a year ago, his body was breaking down. He couldn't hold a spoon to eat breakfast without whiskey — his hands shook too hard. He had alcohol-induced seizures. He said his memories from his unhealthiest times come in flashes: being put on a stretcher, the face of a worried landlord, ambulance lights in the background. James recently graduated from his treatment program. He's staying with a relative to save money as he and his girlfriend try to find an affordable place to rent — though even with Medicaid, finding housing feels like a stretch to him. He's taking classes part time to become a licensed addiction counselor. His dream is to help others survive addiction, and he also sees that career as a way out of poverty. To James, all his progress rides on keeping Medicaid a bit longer. ""Every time I get a piece of mail, I am terrified that I'm gonna open it up and it's gonna say I don't have Medicaid anymore,"" he said. ""I'm constantly in fear that it's gonna go away."" As of mid-July, officials hadn't noticed the extra $50 he makes each week.

health,"Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, D-N.M., speaks in favor of reauthorizing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 2024. The legislation, which will benefit people sickened by radiation exposure in uranium mining and nuclear weapons testing, was included in the budget bill President Trump signed on July 4, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images hide caption Children who lived near a St. Louis creek polluted with radioactive atomic bomb waste from the 1940s through the 1960s were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer over their lifetimes than children who lived farther from the waterway, a new study has found. The findings, published in JAMA Network Open, corroborate worries that neighbors of Coldwater Creek have long held about the Missouri River tributary where generations of children played. ""We actually saw something quite dramatic, not only elevated risk of cancer, but one that increased steadily in a sort of dose-response manner the closer the childhood residents got to Coldwater Creek,"" said the study's senior author, Marc Weisskopf, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As part of the Manhattan Project, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works processed uranium in St. Louis for the development of an atomic bomb. By the mid-1940s, according to historians, the company began to haul its radioactive waste north of the city, leaving it in open steel drums, unattended and exposed to the elements, next to Coldwater Creek. The study's release comes shortly after passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" which contained a little-known provision to help people sickened by exposure to nuclear waste in Missouri and elsewhere. It provides payments of $25,000 to families of people who died as a result of radiation-linked cancers in the St. Louis area and $50,000 to those who developed the cancers and survived. Like the new study, the provision recognizes the potential health risks from lower radiation levels associated with the production of the atomic bomb. Previous legislation, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act , known as RECA, expired last year after paying out $2.6 billion to people who developed cancer after exposure to high-dose radiation from participating in onsite atomic weapon testing, mining or hauling uranium or being downwind of the Nevada test site. U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, made sure the RECA reauthorization was included in the recently passed budget bill and that it included benefits for his constituents who lived near the contaminated creek. Al Drago/Getty Images hide caption Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, pushed to get a new version of RECA into the Trump budget bill. Hawley had been a vocal critic of the BBB's $900 billion cut to Medicaid, but in the end voted for the massive package of tax and spending cuts. Hawley's yes vote came after a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals was added to the BBB. Weisskopf and his research team had the addresses of 4,209 tooth donors from the St. Louis Baby Tooth Survey. Participants, born between 1945 and 1966, donated their baby teeth for science starting in 1958 and joined the new experiment between 2021 and 2024. Weisskopf initially planned to study cognitive decline, but after participants repeatedly mentioned Coldwater Creek, he pivoted to investigating proximity to the creek and cancer risk. Almost one-quarter of the participants reported having cancer. Those who lived within one kilometer of the creek as children were 44% more likely to report having cancer than those who lived more than 20 kilometers away. Even more striking, those who lived within one kilometer of the creek were 85% more likely to have radiosensitive cancers, cancers believed to be caused by radiation. Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist and epidemiology professor at the University of California, said she was impressed with the design of the study, with which she was not involved. ""This study adds to our understanding that radiation is carcinogenic and that we have to be cautious to minimize exposures to radiation wherever possible,"" she said. The main source of exposure today comes from medical imaging, she said. The study also highlights the need to clean up areas, like shipyards, with radioactive waste, she said. Male study participants were more likely than female participants to develop cancer, Smith-Bindman noted. She and Weisskopf hypothesized that the boys were more likely to play in Coldwater Creek in the aftermath of World War II. In 1958, scientists at Washington University began collecting the baby teeth of children from St. Louis. The teeth were used in studies investigating possible links between cancer and the fallout from nuclear tests in the western U.S. St. Louis was chosen not because of its connection to uranium production but because milk in the Midwest had some of the nation's highest levels of strontium-90, a radioactive isotope produced by nuclear fission. High concentrations of strontium-90 found in donated baby teeth contributed to the adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. A 2011 study found that men who were children in St. Louis in the 1960s and died of cancer by middle age had more than twice as much radioactive strontium in their baby teeth as men who grew up nearby and were still alive. Though he did not use the baby teeth in his current study, Weisskopf would like to measure strontium-90 in the teeth in a future study to assess cancer risk and actual exposure. ""As boys, they might have played in the creek way more than girls, and so they got much more exposure,"" he said. ""If that were the case, then the radiation in the teeth should be higher in the boys than in the girls."" Given that the half-life of strontium-90 is 29 years, Weisskopf is eager to begin work on a more detailed study while radiation remains in the baby teeth."
health,"A child receives a cholera vaccine at a temporary treatment center during a past outbreak in Lusaka, Zambia. Namukolo Siyumbwa/Reuters hide caption In South Korea, there's a long hallway lined with walk-in refrigerators. Inside are boxes filled with oral cholera vaccines. This is the emergency cholera vaccine stockpile — and boxes are flying off the shelves to places like Angola, Sudan and South Sudan. ""At the moment, we're shipping about 5 million doses every month, so this means that as soon as the box comes in, another one is going out,"" says Allyson Russell, an epidemiologist at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and a senior program manager for outbreaks and global health security. Gavi, a global public-private organization, funds the stockpile and aims to have a little more than 5 million doses available at any given time, although it has had trouble in the past meeting this target. There are similar stockpiles around the world. In freezers in Switzerland, there are Ebola vaccines. Elsewhere there are meningitis vaccines stored up; same with yellow fever vaccines. While some are kept at ultra-cold temperatures, like the Ebola vaccines, most only need to be refrigerated. ""Imagine sticking your hand in a refrigerator to get out your groceries,"" says Russell. The first global stockpile was established in 1997 when major meningitis outbreaks in Africa prompted public health crisis. The vaccines are available to any country in the world. These stockpiles are now in the spotlight because, for the first time, researchers have quantified just how many lives have been saved by drawing on the stored vaccines. But this news comes against the backdrop of uncertainty. There are new concerns about what the future of these global stockpiles will look like amid a major drop in global health funding. Russell spends her days immersed in the details of the stockpile system. She knows which countries have emailed in the form to request doses from the stockpile. She knows whether the doses are being raced to an outbreak via chartered flight or in the cargo of a commercial airplane. And one thing is clear to her. ""You can see how vaccines change the trajectory of what happens [in an outbreak],"" she says. ""Vaccine can really be a game changer."" But, she says, she's never known exactly how much of a ""game changer"" these stockpiles are — until now. Researchers have crunched the numbers. They looked at more than 200 outbreaks over the past 20-some years, modeling what would happen without the vaccines. Nick Scott , a co-author of the study published this month in the British Medical Journal — Global Health , says the results were exciting: A 60% reduction in cases and deaths from outbreaks because of the stockpile. ""That's quite an amazing thing,"" said Scott, who is head of modeling and biostatistics at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, an independent medical research group. That 60% drop means about 6 million cases were averted and 300,000 deaths were averted. ""This study really was meant to ask the question of, are GAVI stockpiles worthwhile? Is it worthwhile to have them?"" says Dr. Ruth Karron , who is director of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative and was not involved in the study. ""And I think that the answer — very robustly — is absolutely."" The research — which was funded by Gavi and started in early 2024 with the goal of helping inform its strategic planning — found over $32 billion dollars in economic benefits from the stockpiles, given there were fewer deaths and less disability in the 200-some outbreaks researchers considered. The researchers say this is a significant underestimate and the true economic benefits are likely much higher. That's because this calculation does not take into account things like the cost of outbreak response that are avoided or the economic disruptions created by large outbreaks. Based on Gavi's financial planning documents , procurement for the stockpiles costs less than $100 million a year. Scott's team also found that speed really matters. ""When there is an outbreak, the faster the vaccine response can start, the more impactful it will be,"" he says. This matters because containing a disease's spread can mean avoiding huge social disruptions. ""What we found is that these vaccines are really critical for preventing things like school closures, business closures, travel restrictions,"" Scott said. The importance of speed is one of the reasons the stockpiles exist in the first place. ""It can easily take up to a year to make these vaccines. Ebola vaccines take a year. Meningitis vaccines take about four to six months,"" Russell says. ""If you were to place the order and then make the vaccines, who knows what would happen to the outbreak."" However, Scott says, having the vaccines ready is not enough. There also need to be mechanisms in place to get the doses to the outbreak and then administer them to people who live and work in the affected area. As international aid organizations face historic funding cuts these steps could get harder. Karron says the findings come at a particularly important time. Global health funding is dropping to a 15-year low, according to a study published this month in the medical journal The Lancet. And it's forcing international health organizations to grapple with what they can afford to keep and what they have to let go. These days everything is on the table, including the global stockpiles of emergency vaccines, says Karron. Gavi is almost $3 billion short of its budget goal for the next five years. Part of the shortfall comes from the U.S. announcing last month that it will cut off support for Gavi until it is able to ""re-earn the public trust."" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explained the decision by saying Gavi had neglected issues of vaccine safety, an accusation Gavi vigorously denies. Critics says the study RFK Jr. cited as evidence is flawed. This week, the organization's board is meeting to figure out what to prioritize. ""So obviously, everything is up for question,"" Karron says. One challenge with the stockpiles is that stored doses can expire, explains Karron. Doses made for routine immunizations are, generally, used quickly and don't bump up against their expiration dates. That's not a guarantee with the stockpile. Gavi does have a system where once vaccines in the stockpile reach one year left in their shelf life, they can be used in a preventive program — for example in a high-risk location where researchers anticipate meningitis outbreaks. However, Karron says, that is not always possible. ""So, the question is: Is it worth the investment knowing that you might have some vaccine that goes to waste?"" she asks. She says the clear answer from this study is that it's in everyone's interest to keep the emergency vaccine stockpiles fully stocked. ""If we don't want some of these diseases, like Ebola, to come to our [U.S.] shores, we really need to contain them at the source,"" Karron says."
health,"Democratic lawmakers have reintroduced a set of bills called the ""Safer Beauty Bill Package,"" aiming to bring safety and transparency to the largely unregulated cosmetics industry. Nadia Audigie/Getty Images hide caption Personal care, salon and beauty products sold across the U.S. are subject to little federal oversight — and many have been found to contain toxic ingredients. The average American adult uses about 12 personal care products a day, Consumer Reports says , resulting in exposure to an average of 168 chemicals. Those can include formaldehyde, mercury, asbestos, lead and parabens, which have been linked to cancer, brain damage and reproductive harm. Women of color are thought to use twice as many products, according to Consumer Reports . Despite mounting scientific research into the dangers posed by toxic chemicals, little has been done to ban them or at least label them on cosmetics. A group of Democratic lawmakers hopes to change that. On Wednesday, Reps. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, Doris Matsui of California and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced the "" Safer Beauty Bill Package ,"" a set of four bills designed to update what they call ""an increasingly outdated set of federal cosmetics laws."" Each focuses on a different aspect of product safety, from banning the most toxic ingredients in everyday beauty supplies to creating protections for the women of color and salon workers who are disproportionately exposed to them. ""More than 10,000 chemicals are used to make beauty and personal care products,"" said Schakowsky , who authored all four bills. ""We owe it to consumers to ensure the beauty and personal care products they use daily are safe."" This is an updated version of a similar package that lawmakers first introduced in 2021. In 2022, then-President Biden signed into law the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA), which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) calls the most significant expansion of its authority to regulate cosmetics since its creation in 1938. The law gave the FDA power to do things like issue mandatory recalls, require adverse event reporting and suspend manufacturers' facility registration. But lawmakers and consumer safety advocates say it did little to actually improve the safety of beauty and personal care products. The lack of federal action has driven some states — including Vermont, California, Washington and Oregon — to enact their own bans on dozens of chemicals from cosmetic products in recent years. The FDA did not comment when asked about the legislation. The Personal Care Products Council — a leading cosmetics trade industry — told NPR in a statement that it is ""fully committed to upholding the highest standards of safety, quality and transparency for cosmetics and personal care products."" The group says on its website that it has ""a long history of science and safety best practices, often going beyond what is required by law."" In a 2024 statement responding to concerns about PFAS, known as ""forever chemicals,"" in personal care products, the group said that all cosmetic ingredients are subject to the same federal safety requirements, adding that ""member companies take their responsibility for product safety ... very seriously."" Consumer Reports says that the Safer Beauty Bill Package addresses gaps in federal regulation that were not addressed by MoCRA, ""including ingredient safety and transparency, which is what consumers care about most."" The legislation has been endorsed by over 150 companies and organizations , many focused on environmental and consumer health. Janet Nudelman, director of program and policy at Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, said in a statement that the bill package ""matches the new high bar for cosmetic safety established by the states"" and will help the FDA ""get some of the most toxic chemicals on the planet"" out of beauty products. ""These bills recognize that everyone deserves protection from unsafe cosmetic exposures regardless of where they live, shop, or work,"" she added. Studies have linked hair products primarily marketed toward Black women, like straighteners and relaxers, to an increased risk of certain cancers and other health risks. Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption Years of scientific research has linked toxic chemicals in hair, makeup and other personal care products to health problems including hormone disruption, respiratory issues, adverse reproductive outcomes and cancer. That's especially worrisome for Black and Latina women, whom research shows are more often exposed to dangerous ingredients like formaldehyde in nail and hair products. A Consumer Reports study published in March found cancer-causing ingredients in 100% of the 10 most popular synthetic hair products used in braids, extensions and other hairstyles popular with Black women. Another study, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters in May, found that formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing products are present not only in hair relaxers but in a wide range of beauty products that get even more regular use, including soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner and eyeliner. And a report released Thursday by Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, looking at the dangers of fragrances specifically, found that over 98% of fragrance chemicals either lack basic safety data or are classified as high or potentially high concern by scientific authorities. ""A gaping federal labeling loophole combined with a self-regulated fragrance industry allows for dozens — sometimes even hundreds — of chemicals to hide under the words, 'fragrance,' 'parfum,' 'aroma' or 'flavor' on the product labels of beauty and personal care products,"" the report reads. Consumer advocates say product safety is becoming even more urgent, as girls turn to makeup and skincare products at a younger age and breast cancer rates on the rise among women under 65. While the European Union has banned over 2,400 toxic chemicals from personal care products, the FDA only restricts about a dozen . Advocates and lawmakers want the U.S. to start catching up. ""It's time to close the loopholes that allow toxic chemicals in the products we use on our bodies every day,"" Schakowsky said. The bills have been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for consideration, the first step in the legislative process. Here's what they would do if passed: Janette Robinson Flint, co-founder and executive director of Black Women for Wellness, said in a statement that she hopes Congress will ""meet this moment with a sense of urgency."" ""Women, girls, and all people in this country deserve better from our legislators, regulatory agencies (EPA/FDA), and corporations,"" she said."
health,"A poll of parents last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. Boys took it to bulk up; girls took it to replace meals. Huizeng Hu/Moment RF/Getty Images hide caption Emiliano Slesaransky, 17, joined Santa Monica High School's football team as a freshman and — at the urging of coaches and teammates— started hitting the gym whenever possible: in the morning, after school and on the weekends. The people he met there would share their strategies for bulking up. ""They would take protein powders, other supplements like some people I know take ashwagandha, and maybe creatine,"" he says, citing popular energy and exercise-enhancing supplements. Emiliano started taking some of them, too. But his dad, Eduardo Slesaransky, wanted to make sure his son's diet — and attitude — remained balanced: ""My concern was the influence that social media has on these supplements and these kinds of things and the culture of bodybuilding and the gyms."" Protein supplements are big on social media, where influencers are helping drive sales of protein bars, shakes and powders. A poll of parents by the Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. ""Teen boys were more likely — twice as likely — to consume protein every day,"" says Sarah Clark , a research scientist and co-director of the poll . Girls, she says, more often relied on supplements as meal replacements, and the inspiration to consume protein shakes, bars or powders often came from coaches, peers, or influencers on social media. But Clark says parents were also among those promoting protein to their children. ""I wonder if, as parents, we are recognizing how much messaging we have taken in about protein being good,"" she says. ""We have absorbed this messaging: That's the key to being healthy,"" she says, when in fact it is only one factor in a balanced, healthy diet. The vast majority of teens already get enough protein in their diet without supplements, pediatric dietitian Abriana Cain says. Elkhophoto/iStockphoto/Getty Images hide caption There is also such a thing as too much protein, says Abriana Cain, a pediatric dietitian with Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. As a general rule, Cain tells teens and parents to gauge protein intake based on size — benchmarked at roughly 1 gram of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. (For a 150-pound teen, that amounts to about 68 grams of protein per day — or the rough equivalent of a cup of cooked chicken, a cup of yogurt and a cup of black beans.) ""It might even increase from there, based on their physical activity needs,"" she says. Cain says more than 100 grams a day can damage the kidneys and liver in the longer term. It can also cause stomach pain, as it did for one of her patients. ""They were eating protein supplements with all of their meals and also with all of their snacks, and they were having a lot of abdominal pain."" The vast majority of teens, Cain says, already get enough protein in their diet without supplements. There are also concerns about the marketing of supplements. There is no quality control for these products, notes pediatrician and eating disorder expert Dr. Jason Nagata , at the University of California San Francisco. Supplements, including protein bars and powders, are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration in the same way as drugs — so they're not tested before going on the market, and their ingredients aren't verified before they are sold. Manufacturers are responsible for evaluating the safety and labelling of their products. The FDA does have the authority to take action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. ""I think it's important for teens and parents to know that there isn't that kind of rigorous quality control, especially when you're getting mixtures of muscle-building supplements and products,"" he says. ""I would just be very cautious."" Nagata advises researching, reading ingredient labels and buying directly from known companies. Some products have been found to have contaminants such as heavy metals, bacteria, or chemicals or adulterants not listed on the label. Separately, Nagata is concerned that the protein craze is contributing to the alarming increase in eating disorders among boys over the past two decades worldwide . He observes that over that time period, action figures like Batman and Superman are sold with bigger muscles, and pressures on ordinary teenagers to post attractive photos of themselves to be popular online have increased. ""The masculine body ideal has become increasingly large and muscular, and so more and more boys are trying to become muscular now than they have ever before,"" he says. Emiliano Slesaransky stopped using protein powders about a year ago, he says, largely because he started forgetting to take it. His father, Eduardo, says his son still looks very strong and fit, but is no longer fixated with bulking up for sports. ""He's focusing on getting into college."""
business,"A General Motors logo is seen at the General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant in Hamtramck, Mich. on Jan. 27, 2020. Paul Sancya/AP hide caption In a quarterly earnings call with investors, the chief financial officer of General Motors said Tuesday morning that tariffs cost the company approximately $1.1 billion over three months, bringing the company's profit margin from 9% down to 6.1% — that is, from meeting their target profitability to falling several percentage points short. CFO Paul Jacobson said that so far, the company has only been able to reduce the blow to profits by a minimal amount. But they're hoping that will change. ""We're still tracking to offset at least 30% of the $4 to $5 billion full-year 2025 tariff impact,"" he said, through a combination of changes in manufacturing, ""targeted cost initiatives,"" and the prices that consumers pay. U.S. tariff policy has been unpredictable and rapidly changing over the last few months , and GM executives acknowledged that's likely to continue. For example, the possibility of bilateral deals between the U.S. and other countries suggests that some of those costs might be avoided entirely. For now, despite a tariff of 25%, GM is still importing vehicles it makes in Korea, including some of its most affordable models. ""They're very much in demand,"" CEO Mary Barra told investors. GM stock dropped 6% after it revealed its earnings, signaling Wall Street's displeasure with the company's strategy so far of absorbing tariffs as a hit to profits. ""To put full year targets in reach,"" analysts Daniel Roska and Christopher Gray of research and brokerage firm Bernstein wrote in a note, ""GM needs to start mitigating tariff cost."" Meanwhile, Stellantis, the automaker that owns the Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Ram brands, reported this week that it paid about $387 million in tariffs over the last quarter, and that production pauses — a strategy to avoid paying tariffs — contributed to a 6% year-over-year decline in the number of vehicles the company shipped to dealers. Industry-wide data has suggested that, at least so far, car manufacturers have mostly absorbed higher tariffs as a hit to their profits, rather than passing them along to customers (many of whom are already balking at new car prices that average nearly $49,000 .) The most recent data from Kelley Blue Book showed the average price that car buyers paid for new vehicles in June was up 1.2% year over year, well below the 10-year average annual increase. ""The modest increase in transaction prices suggests the businesses are absorbing more of the burden and not passing the added costs to consumers — something that will impact profitability if the trend persists,"" Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, wrote in a post accompanying the data."
business,"President Trump with Jerome Powell after nominating him as chair in 2017. Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America hide caption President Trump indicated on Tuesday he would let Jerome Powell serve out his term as Federal Reserve chair, saying ""he's going to be out pretty soon anyway."" The comment comes as the president has relentlessly attacked Powell in recent weeks for not cutting interest rates. Last week, Trump floated the idea of firing Powell before retreating somewhat and adding he's ""not planning"" to fire the Fed chair, though without fully ruling it out. An attempt to fire Powell could spark a legal battle, because the Federal Reserve is set up to function as an independent body free of political interference. Such a move would likely also roil financial markets. On Tuesday, while answering questions from reporters, Trump again attacked Powell for being too cautious on cutting interest rates. ""I call him too late. He's too late all the time,"" Trump said. ""He should have lowered interest rates many times."" He went on to say that Powell is leaving his post soon enough anyway, indicating he was willing to wait out his term as chair of the Fed, which ends on May of next year. Despite the president's attacks, Powell has been adamant he intends to serve out his term as chair. The Fed has held interest rates steady this year in large part over concerns that President Trump's tariffs could spark an increase on inflation. That's after cutting rates by a full percentage point between September and December last year. With concerns over inflation rising again, the Fed is seen as unlikely to cut rates at its next policy meeting later this month. In June, consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year ago , a faster annual clip than in the previous month. Policy makers had previously indicated they may consider cutting rates by half a percentage point later this year. Top government officials have also stepped up their criticism of Powell's tenure at the Fed. On Monday, in a post on social media platform X, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for ""a review"" of the Fed's operations, saying the central bank had excessively extended its purview into areas outside of its core job of setting interest rates. Bessent also called for a review of the Fed's renovation project, which President Trump and some Republican lawmakers have seized on to further attack Powell. The Fed is embarking on a makeover of its offices in Washington, D.C., with the cost of the project soaring from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion in recent years. Powell has pushed back against some of the most sensational claims of the renovations as exaggerated. The Fed has attributed the cost overruns to unexpected developments like excess lead and asbestos, as well as inflation, which has raised the cost of building projects nationwide. Powell has also asked the Fed's inspector general to review the project, in an effort to address complaints about the price tag."
business,"NPR's chief news executive and acting content chief, Edith Chapin, told colleagues Tuesday morning that she has decided to step down. Stephen Voss/NPR hide caption NPR's editor-in-chief and acting chief content officer, Edith Chapin, told colleagues Tuesday morning that she has decided to step down. The veteran news leader's announcement comes just days after the Republican-led Congress, driven largely by President Trump's claims of liberal bias at NPR, voted to strip public broadcasting of all federal funding. Chapin says the choice was hers and not driven by the action in Congress. In a brief interview, she says she surprised NPR CEO Katherine Maher with her decision two weeks ago. ""I have had two big executive jobs for two years, and I want to take a break. I want to make sure my performance is always top-notch for the company,"" Chapin says. She says she expects to stay at NPR until September or October. In a note to staff, Maher thanked Chapin for her work. ""Edith has been an indispensable partner during my first year at NPR, a steady leader for a large part of this organization, and a fantastic collaborator as a member of the executive team,"" she wrote. She did not offer any details about transition planning and interim leadership, saying she would share more once she had it. Chapin joined NPR from CNN in 2012 as chief international editor and rose in the ranks of newsroom leadership. She was promoted to lead the newsroom on a day-to-day basis and was subsequently elevated to senior vice president of news and editor-in-chief over the entire division. In 2023, then-NPR CEO John Lansing united reporting, shows and podcasts. He named Chapin to temporarily hold the new role of chief content officer overseeing the new division. She turned the content job down on a permanent basis, saying that someone with a different skill set needed to chart NPR's strategy for what material to present to audiences and how to fulfill its mission. Nearly two years later, Chapin still holds that role on an acting basis. ""It's not a good time to do it, but it's never a good time,"" Chapin says of her choice to leave. ""I needed to pick a date and share my decision."" The ramifications of the congressional vote could have consequences for years to come for public broadcasting, which aims to serve the entire U.S. population. This week, in interviews with the Status media newsletter's Oliver Darcy and with Texas Public Radio , Maher said that NPR would reduce its operating budget by $8 million in the year ahead to pass that along as fee relief to the most affected stations. NPR typically receives less than 2% of its funds from federal sources. But federal funding makes up a greater share of member stations' revenue — on average about 8% to 10%. Some stations, particularly those serving rural or tribal audiences, receive more than half of their funds from the U.S. government. PBS and its member stations receive, on average, about 15% of revenues from U.S. taxpayers. That is to stop on Oct. 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year. In an interview last week on NPR's Morning Edition with hosts Michel Martin and Steve Inskeep, Maher said she had not given up hope that public broadcasting could ultimately convince lawmakers on Capitol Hill to restore some federal funding. Periodic accusations of bias, especially from conservatives, erupted last year when a veteran NPR business editor wrote an essay in The Free Press asserting that the network had embraced a progressive outlook. Chapin led the effort to hire a new team of senior editors to review broadcast segments, digital stories and podcasts before their release — to ensure both that the stories were fair and accurate, and also that the balance of stories was proportionate to the news of the day. ""The best thing we can do is do the best work possible every day,"" Chapin says now about the debate over bias. ""We need to hear from all kinds of people — and that is our job. And we need to be as clear and transparent as we possibly can, and our audiences can decide how useful we are for them."" That venture was subsidized by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit through which federal funding has been funneled to stations and the networks for decades. Under Chapin, NPR has helped foster the creation of seven regional newsrooms — each distinct in its focus — in which the network's editors have helped oversee collaborative reporting with stations. One of those efforts, The Texas Newsroom, has broken several stories and offered intensive coverage during the deadly floods in Texas. ""One of the things that was attractive when I came here was this philosophy of all things considered,"" Chapin says, playing off the name of NPR's signature evening newsmagazine. ""There is room for so much here in a way there is not in so many places. In offering that fulsome package of things, some people are going to find things they don't find of interest or agree with — and that's OK. I think we have to continue with that philosophy of all things considered."" Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR correspondent David Folkenflik.

business,"In this undated image provided by the CPSC, a child uses the compression strap to stand on above-ground pool. (CPSC via AP) CPSC/AP hide caption NEW YORK — More than 5.2 million aboveground swimming pools sold across the U.S. and Canada over the last two decades are being recalled after nine drowning deaths were reported. The recall covers a range of Bestway, Intex Recreation and Polygroup pools that were sold by major retailers as far back as 2002. According to Monday notices published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada , these pools have compression straps running along the outside of the product — which ""may create a foothold"" for small children and allow them to access the water unattended. That can pose a serious drowning risk, the safety regulatory warn. To date, the CPSC believes nine children across the U.S. have drowned after gaining access to these now-recalled pools in this way. Those deaths occurred between 2007 and 2022, involving children between the ages of 22 months and 3 years old. No additional fatalities have been reported in Canada. Consumers in possession of these pools are urged to immediately contact Bestway , Intex and/or Polygroup to receive a free repair kit — which will consist of a rope to replace the compression strap. Owners of these pools should otherwise ensure that small children cannot access the pool without supervision, regulators note — and could alternatively drain the pool until the repair is made. All of the pools being recalled are 48 inches or taller — and can be identified by brand and model names listed on both the CPSC and Health Canada's recall notices . Sales of the pools ranged by model and location, but date as far back to 2002 and as recently as 2025. About 5 million of these now-recalled pools were sold across the U.S. — including both online and in-stores at major retailers like Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Costco and Amazon. Another 266,000 were sold in Canada."
business,"Jeff Yerxa, co-owner of Lost Sock Roasters, shows bags of coffee beans, many from Brazil, at the company's warehouse in Washington, D.C. The looming threat of a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil — the world's largest coffee producer — has sent shock waves through the U.S. coffee industry. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption At a small, industrial roastery in Washington, D.C., the nutty, inviting smell of roasting coffee hangs heavy in the air. It's where Lost Sock Roasters, a local company, roasts and packages its coffee beans — destined for its two cafes, customers' homes and local bakeries and restaurants. After nearly a decade of running the company with co-founder Nico Cabrera, Lost Sock's Jeff Yerxa says the strong coffee aroma barely registers. ""I can't even smell it anymore,"" he says with a laugh. But something else is grabbing his attention these days: tariffs. This month, President Trump announced plans to levy a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil — the world's largest coffee producer and the source of about 30% of U.S. coffee imports. That's on top of the 10% tariff that impacts nearly everything the U.S. brings in. This looming tariff threat has sent shock waves through the U.S. coffee industry, raising fears especially among small roasters like Lost Sock. ""When people go to their local coffee shop, whether it's Starbucks or something else, by and large they will likely be buying some form of Brazilian coffee,"" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""A 50% tariff will kill that market."" Yerxa holds some green coffee beans before they are roasted at Lost Sock Roasters in Washington, D.C. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption While the tariffs on imports from Brazil, as well as on imports from other nations, aren't set to begin until Aug. 1 , the uncertainty is rattling the industry already. But it's consumers who will end up paying the price, de Bolle, Yerxa and others warn. ""It's a massive price impact ,"" de Bolle says. Tariff threats extend beyond imports from Brazil: The Trump administration has announced a number of tariffs on imports from other coffee-producing countries, like Vietnam (which produces 17% of the world's coffee), Colombia (which produces 8%) and Ethiopia and Indonesia (which produce 6% each). Yerxa says he is trying not to react until he knows details are final, but he says profit margins are already thin. ""It's the uncertainty that's probably the worst."" ""At the end of the day, the consumer is the one that's going to bear the brunt of it,"" he says. ""I don't want to raise prices, but we're seeing increased costs of 30% on coffee, potentially.""

Andre Penner/AP hide caption The Trump administration defends its trade policy and the dozens of tariffs on a number of countries as necessary to protect American jobs, to renegotiate trade deals and to reduce the trade deficit. In the case of Brazil, Trump also indicated that the proposed tariffs are political retribution for the treatment of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently on trial for trying to overturn the country's 2022 election. For roasters like Yerxa and Colby Barr, CEO and co-founder of Verve Coffee Roasters, a Santa Cruz, Calif.-based craft coffee roaster and wholesaler launched in 2007, much of the administration's reasoning falls flat. The U.S., aside from small coffee farms in Hawaii and California, doesn't produce coffee at the scale that Americans consume it. ""It's a tax on Americans' mornings,"" Barr says. The past several years have been volatile for the coffee industry, contributing to a major increase in market prices for coffee even in the last year, Barr says. The price volatility can be attributed, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic and back-to-back low-yield coffee harvests in Brazil in the last year, Yerxa says. Those weak harvests , in turn, are due to drought and high temperatures and more generally climate change , which has negatively impacted coffee harvests for several years. Coffee producer Jose Natal da Silva sifts coffee beans on his farm in Porciúncula, in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, on July 17. Bruna Prado/AP hide caption Roasted coffee prices in the U.S. surged 12.7% in June compared with a year prior, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Instant coffee saw a 16.3% increase. The average retail price for a pound of ground coffee was $8.13 in June, up more than $1 per pound since the start of the year. Nika Finkelstein says she's already well aware of the sticker shock that comes with buying coffee out. The 27-year-old sat outside Blue Bottle Coffee at Union Station in Washington, D.C., on a recent July afternoon. She makes coffee at home as much as possible. On the rare occasions she buys one out, she sticks with drip coffee rather than specialty drinks, like a latte. If tariffs bump prices even higher? ""I would just have to reel back on spending money at coffee shops and just make it from home, which I can do — it's just not as fun,"" she says. ""There's a certain romance to being able to go to the coffee shop and sit there and read your book or scroll on your phone."" So much coffee in the U.S. comes from Brazil because of the country's large-scale production capacity, low costs, favorable climate and flavor profile, Yerxa and de Bolle say. ""Most of the industry relies on those coffees to be the backbone of their blends,"" Yerxa says, referring to the mixture of beans from different regions. Walking away from longtime partnerships in Brazil really isn't an option, Yerxa says. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption Lost Sock, the D.C. coffee company, is best known for single-origin, higher-end coffees sourced from nearly a dozen countries each year. But it uses Brazilian beans for some of its blends — products that stem from its long-standing relationships with two cooperatives in Brazil. Getting those beans from Brazil to D.C. is a long process that involves international partners, contracts negotiated months to years in advance, and plenty of other planning. Lost Sock coordinates with producers and exporters, and it places orders with them for specific amounts of specific beans from specific Brazilian farms, exports the coffee, and stores it in a U.S. warehouse. The importer adds a margin for logistics, and Yerxa then factors that final price per pound into Lost Sock's wholesale and retail pricing. And where would the tariffs come in? That is initially something that the importer would have to pay once it brings beans into the U.S., he says. ""That tariff would just be another line item on the receipt that we're getting when we release that coffee. And then for us, we take that coffee price, and again it's added on to the price per pound of that coffee, when we come up with the pricing for wholesale and for retail."" Kristen Tizaawie-Vogel (left) prepares a drink at a Lost Sock Roasters coffee shop in Washington, D.C. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption De Bolle explains that if tariffs hit on Aug. 1, it could be a few months before customers feel price increases at cafes or restaurants. That's because those businesses generally buy in bulk and have a stock of coffee that could last them a while — stockpiles like this could last a few months, she says. People who buy their coffee beans at the grocery store could feel the tariff impacts more quickly. ""For people who don't stock up, so the regular consumer who's going to the supermarket … and getting their coffee, maybe those price increases will be felt sooner,"" de Bolle says, adding that coffee is perishable and stocking up on beans can get a business, or consumer, only so far. Long term, if it looks like these tariffs stick, Lost Sock may have to consider pivoting away from using Brazilian coffees in some blends, Yerxa says. Walking away from longtime partnerships in Brazil really isn't an option for him, however. ""It feels unfair to pull out of a relationship when the going gets tough,"" he says. ""So we'll probably bear the brunt of it a little bit, but with the hope that the prices in the future will come back down."" Yerxa brews a cup of coffee with freshly roasted beans at Lost Sock's roastery. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption But if Brazil's coffee prices go up, coffee roasters will rush to buy from other sources, Barr of Verve Coffee warns. And these other coffee-producing countries, such as Vietnam, are also facing tariffs. ""It's really, really difficult, and more like impossible, to really prepare for it,"" Barr says. ""Tariffs don't help the coffee producer. They don't help the small- and medium-sized businesses across the country, and they don't help the consumer. Why are we doing it?"""
climate,"Experts say there are key questions parents and guardians should ask camp operators about wildfires, flood and heat risk. Danielle Villasana for The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption The deaths of at least 27 children and staff at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas have some parents and guardians questioning the safety of summer camps, especially as global warming increases risks of extreme weather. Part of summer camp's allure is that children are outside in nature. But that can also raise the possibility of heat illness and risks from greater proximity to wildfire or flood-prone areas, says Tracey Gaslin,  chief executive of the nonprofit Alliance for Camp Health in Kentucky. Outside of regulations that apply to all businesses, there are no federal standards that are specific to camps, says Henry DeHart, interim chief executive of the American Camp Association (ACA). The ACA has a national accreditation program that includes some health and safety standards, but it's voluntary and only about 12% of the country's roughly 20,000 camps have participated, he says. On the state level, DeHart says some state agencies conduct camp health and safety inspections. But oversight and protections vary considerably from state to state, and some states have very little regulation. ""There are a lot of states that have very little or no regulation related to camp,"" DeHart says. ""The regulatory framework is wide and varied and, in some places, it's not very robust."" Because of the gaps in the current regulatory framework, some experts on climate-related risks say parents and guardians should ask more detailed questions about campers' safety. Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers , dropped off his 8-year-old daughter at Girl Scout Camp earlier this month, and realized he, too, had many more questions about his daughter's camp's flood precautions. ""Even as a floodplain manager,"" he says, ""I don't think I even had appreciation for what, as a parent, I should be thinking about when sending kids to camp."" Now, Berginnis has a list of points to cover. For parents or guardians sending children to any kind of camp, here are the top questions experts say you should be asking about increased risks of heat, wildfires and floods. Camps can be great for kids, but can also expose them to heat. Children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies. Serhii Bezrukyi/Getty Images hide caption This question is important because heat-related illness and death are major and growing risks in the U.S. —and that threat is often underestimated. Also, children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies, says Rupa Basu,  senior science advisor for the University of California, San Francisco Center for Climate Health and Equity . That makes them more at risk for heat illness, she says. ""I  think that people don't even think of children often as being high risk populations,"" Basu says. "" But they absolutely are."" For these reasons, Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health thinks parents and guardians should be asking camps how they are thinking about heat and hydration. She suggests parents and guardians ask about how the camp's physical site is designed. "" Do you have things like shade structures? Misting systems?"" Gaslin says. ""A really solid infrastructure build is important."" Gaslin also thinks parents and guardians should be asking about how ""climate-aware"" the campers' schedules are. That can look like an activity in a cool location, then an activity outside in a warmer location, then back into the cool, she says. Also it's important to ask about how frequently counselors are reminding campers to hydrate. ""It's really about giving conscious thought to how do we manage that impact of heat,"" she says. "" If we're gonna be outdoors, guess what? Water activities are a great thing to do."" Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP hide caption This question is key because many camps are located in flood-prone areas, Berginnis says. He says – in many ways – that's understandable. ""To me, it makes logical sense that you'd have a lot of camps there because it has really interesting habitats. It has interesting animals and geology and everything, and kids can learn a lot there,"" Berginnis says. But he thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Berginnis says adults can look up risks on this FEMA website . Parents and guardians can also plug in addresses to this database from First Street , a climate risk modeling company. If it's a sleep-away camp, Berginnis says it's important to ask where the kids' sleeping quarters are located. ""If it's an overnight camp, any kind of residential lodging overnight for the kids, if it's in a floodway, that should be a huge red flag right there,"" he says. And he says parents and guardians should ask camps about things like flood sirens and specifics of emergency action plans. "" I would be very blunt with a campground: I wanna know the procedure. If a flash flood warning is declared for the area, what does the camp do? What do the counselors do? So that they can talk it through with you,"" he says in an email. ""Do not be satisfied with a generic answer like 'we have an emergency action plan'. Ask them about specific actions like is there anyone monitoring the weather at night? What are the designated evacuation areas? And if they cannot talk that through with you, again, I would say, that's another red flag."" Tracey Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health says parents and guardians should make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images hide caption As with flood risks, parents and guardians should be asking about emergency action plans and preparedness for wildfire and smoke, Gaslin says. ""Parents can ask camps, do they monitor air quality?"" she says, ""What's their evacuation plan? How are they gonna communicate with families? So families are gonna be able to say, in a moment of crisis, I wanna be able to communicate with you in some way."" Gaslin says it's important to make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Gaslin says parents and guardians should make sure there are always staff monitoring the weather, and at sleepaway camps there should be a solid communication system so at night, individuals are alerted to environmental changes or concerns. That means at least some staff with cell phones and radios at all hours, to monitor for wildfire risk, flash floods, or any other hazards."
climate,"People swim in the Blanco River by a low water crossing on River Road across from 7A Ranch in Wimberley, Texas, on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption WIMBERLEY, Texas — On a hot and humid mid-July afternoon, cars rumble down the streets of downtown Wimberley. Visitors browse Western-themed shops boasting vintage cowboy boots, cacti and local wine. Fourth of July banners blow in the wind, lining a bridge spanning a small creek that trickles through town. People float on inner tubes in the nearby Blanco River, sipping beers and splashing in the water. Ten years ago, this area was practically unrecognizable. On Memorial Day weekend in 2015, the Blanco River suddenly rose more than 40 feet in the middle of the night, swelling to about a quarter of a mile wide in some places and carrying away nearly everything in its path. At least 12 people were killed, including several children, and hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, according to local authorities. Since then, the small town of roughly 3,000 has focused on rebuilding itself with a potential flood like that in mind, installing new safety measures and alert systems with financial help from the state. But residents and government officials say that the recent deadly, destructive flooding in nearby Kerr County earlier this month has reinforced the need for more preparedness in flood-prone areas like Wimberley. It's also reopened old emotional wounds that still hadn't fully healed. ""It's really hard for us to watch the news right now, because it's just so eerily similar to what we went through that night 10 years ago,"" says resident and business owner Natalie Meeks. Natalie Meeks, co-owner of Water's Point Resort, said that she and her husband are constructing this building to be 3 feet higher than the updated flood maps for the area. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption She and her husband run a vacation resort along the Blanco River, which has been in his family for nearly a hundred years. Today, the river is calm, down a bank and a few hundred feet away from the nearest cabins. But during the flood, Meeks says those cabins ended up 20 feet under water. She and her husband woke up in the middle of the night to phone calls and alerts from people upriver, and rushed to the cabins to pull guests out — in some cases, physically carrying them — trying to find higher ground as the property was swallowed by the river. Loading... ""The only light source we had was lightning and transformers blowing,"" Meeks remembers. ""All you could hear was the ancient cypress trees just snapping, and the river just wasn't stopping."" She says they could hear houses being carried down the river, the people inside screaming for help. There was nothing they could do. All 100 guests and Meeks' family survived that night, but the water washed two of the cabins away. The rest of the structures were severely damaged. Meeks says it took nearly a year just to clear debris after the flood. Since then, it's been one project after another. On the far end of the Meeks' vacation resort, a cabin built on stilts engineered to withstand the rush of future flood waters is in the middle of construction. ""Even after seeing the aftermath of the flood, I didn't comprehend how much time and money it would take to rebuild. It's overwhelming,"" Meeks says, noting that it's not just about the physical rebuilding. ""It's emotional for a long time. It's just a long, long process."" This area in central Texas has long been known as Flash Flood Alley. Droughts cause rivers to run nearly dry for months, sometimes years at a time; heavy rains then make them suddenly overflow. Locals know that floods are part of life; often, they welcome the rain to replenish the water in swimming areas popular with tourists. But so-called 100-year-floods have been happening more frequently , as climate change is driving more intense rain storms across much of the U.S., dropping more water in shorter periods of time. This month's disaster in Kerr County has some of Wimberley's residents thinking about the possibility of another flood in their area, says Mayor Jim Chiles, who was not mayor at the time of the 2015 flood but has been since May 2024. Jim Chiles, mayor of Wimberley, Texas, is photographed at the local Dairy Queen on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Mayor Chiles says he has already had talks with city leaders about putting flooding infrastructure and safety front and center, specifically looking into an audible, citywide alert system like sirens, something many communities in the area are talking about as the death toll from Kerr County's floods has hit at least 130. Many think that might have helped save lives, especially when flooding happens in the middle of the night. ""It's all very premature, but we had an agenda setting meeting,"" he says. ""We put something on there to talk about sirens. Sirens are very expensive, and we gotta figure out how to do that."" He says he's hopeful the state will step in to help with it. Ten years after the 2015 Memorial Day flood in Wimberley, Texas, the Water's Point Resort is in the construction process for replacing the last cabin on the property to be lost during the flood. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption After Wimberley's flood in 2015, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott transferred $6.8 million from a state disaster contingency fund for statewide floodplain management, as well as more river gauges, which monitor the level of the water and send real-time information to weather alert systems. Wimberley's then-mayor Steve Thurber secured several new  gauges for the town, which only had one before the flood and was swept away during the storm. Since then, three have been installed upriver, allowing for much more accurate monitoring. But securing more funding will likely be difficult. Kerr County tried for years — and ultimately failed — to find a way to pay for a new alert system, including sirens. And now, prospects are even more limited, as the Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions of dollars dedicated to help rural communities prepare for disasters. Seventy-seven year-old Jim Venable has lived in Wimberley for most of his life, and while he hopes more infrastructure for flooding and alerts will be put in, he's not optimistic. ""Well, it's always about the dollars, right? You know, how much are the people worth?,"" he says. Jim Venable, 77, a construction superintendent in Wimberley Texas, poses for a portrait at the Wimberley Visitor Center on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Venable was a construction contractor nearby in Austin before the flooding. But afterward, he quit that job to focus on rebuilding Wimberley. ""I think there's still a lot of PTSD after the fact,"" he says, adding that over the Fourth of July weekend, as Kerr County flooded, residents in Wimberley were on edge. ""We're just looking at the rain, and we're just going, well, is that going to hit here or what's going to happen?"" Wimberley sits in Hays County, one of the fastest-growing counties in both Texas and the U.S, according to recent census data . In the summer, the population booms as it welcomes tourists and seasonal summer residents alike, according to town officials. The town is just 40 miles from Austin, making it a popular vacation spot for city dwellers. Venable says he welcomes the extra people coming to enjoy the town, but their presence highlights an even greater need for flood protections. ""We keep inviting people to come in, but we've got to protect them and take care of them, because we're apt to get these storms anytime,"" he says. Gabrielle Snyder, visitor services coordinator with the City of Wimberley, poses for a portrait at the Wimberley Visitor Center on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Gabrielle Snyder works as a visitor services coordinator for Wimberley's tourism department. She says since the flooding in Kerr County, she's had tourists call, concerned about upcoming trips to Wimberley. ""You want to be sympathetic and supportive, but we weren't affected by these latest floods,"" she says. She says part of her job is telling visitors about the need to sign up for flood alert systems and participate in emergency preparedness. But she has to walk a fine line, because the town wants — and needs — people to come. ""Obviously, Wimberley knows better than a lot of communities how devastating this situation is, but at the same time, you know, Wimberley is open,"" Snyder says. A ""Wimberley Strong"" flag flies at the Village Store in Wimberley, Texas, on July 9. The flag was created after the 2015 Memorial Day flood, which killed at least a dozen people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Her house flooded back in 2015, forcing her, her husband and her daughter, who was 9 years old at the time, to quickly grab what they could and evacuate. It was a rental property, and the damage was so severe that it was eventually torn down. For a time, they lived in an RV borrowed from a friend, until they bought a home in a different part of Wimberley — with one major requirement. ""Never again will we live on the river,"" Snyder says. After witnessing what a powerful flood can do, she says she's fine with appreciating the river from a distance."
climate,"In the coming months, there will be ""a 'hurry-up-and-buy' 'limited-time-offer' kind of dynamic"" to get government incentives for home solar and other energy-efficient technologies, says Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America. Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption If you've wanted to install rooftop solar panels or buy an electric vehicle in recent years, you've probably been able to get federal money for them in the form of tax credits. But those incentives are going away now that President Trump signed what he's called the "" One Big Beautiful Bill "" into law on July 4. That means in the coming months there will be ""a 'hurry-up-and-buy' 'limited-time-offer' kind of dynamic"" to get these government incentives, says Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America . ""If you want to access them, then really you need to get going,"" he says. Here's what you need to know about what's happening to federal tax incentives for everything from solar panels to heat pumps to electric vehicles, and how much time you have to get that federal money. The country's first major climate policy under the Biden administration secured at least a decade of federal tax incentives for rooftop solar panels, solar water heaters and geothermal heat pumps, says Sean Gallagher , vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association. These technologies not only reduce climate pollution, they also make energy bills more affordable. Scientists say that solar energy plus batteries, as well as energy-efficient appliances, are all reliable technologies that can save households money. Despite the evidence, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers wrote in an email to NPR, ""Instead of subsidizing unreliable energy sources at the expense of hardworking taxpayers, President Trump is unleashing American energy to lower costs to provide further relief for businesses and families."" The tax credit meant homeowners could get up to 30% off the cost of installation or equipment . That tax incentive goes away Dec. 31. Matusiak suggests that people sign a contract with a contractor and pay for and install the project before the end of the calendar year so that they can secure their eligibility for the tax credit. Solar project installation can take a few months and some contractors can have long wait times. That's why he suggests talking to a contractor as soon as possible. If people are buying efficient heat pumps or installing home solar, experts suggest signing a contract with a contractor and paying for and installing the project before Dec. 31 to secure eligibility for the federal tax credit. Tristan Spinski for The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption In addition to the 30% off investments in things like home solar, a federal incentive called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit will also disappear later this year. That credit meant up to $2,000 off heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or biomass boilers on your tax bill. To qualify, appliances must have a high efficiency rating. Some manufacturer websites list tax credit-eligible equipment, as does the Energy Star Product Finder . The tax credit also offered up to $1,200 off home upgrades like new insulation, doors and windows. To qualify for this tax credit, it's not enough to just purchase the equipment. They must be ""placed in service"" during the calendar year — another reason Matusiak suggests moving quickly. Dealers are scrambling to sell qualifying EVs on their lots before the tax credits disappear. ""This is going to be the best time to buy an EV in a long time,"" says Pat Ryan of the car-buying app CoPilot. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Currently, some electric vehicle buyers are eligible for a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for buying or leasing a new EV, and up to $4,000 for a used vehicle. That money is available as a cash rebate at the time of purchase and can be used as a down payment. (Not every buyer and not every vehicle qualifies. You can read more about these credits here .) The new law ends those credits after Sept. 30, over the protests of auto dealers, who said such a rapid change will be disruptive. Rogers at the White House wrote in an email to NPR that ending the tax incentives will ""lower costs and incentivize Made in America products."" Dealers are now scrambling to sell qualifying EVs on their lots before the tax credits disappear. ""This is going to be the best time to buy an EV in a long time,"" says Pat Ryan of the car-buying app CoPilot. ""But, of course, that will go away when prices effectively go up when the rebate ends."" The nonprofit research group Resources for the Future says that its modeling suggests EV sales as a share of the total U.S. market could contract by a third with the end of the credits. That doesn't mean the end of the EV industry, analysts say. ""Automakers have spent literally billions of dollars building out supply chains,"" says Joseph Yoon of the auto data company Edmunds. ""I don't think it's just going to turn around and say, 'Oh, well, that was a fun little experiment.'"" But it could significantly reduce the pace of EV adoption and, as a result, lock in decades worth of future carbon pollution from the gas-powered vehicles being sold today. EV tax credits do boost EV sales, but they require a high government expenditure for each additional sale they encourage; some economic research has suggested that putting money toward chargers is a more cost-effective policy approach. The Trump administration has been working to roll back charger funding, too. The tax-and-spending package will end a credit available to businesses and individuals to help with the costs of installing EV chargers, specifically in low-income or rural areas. That credit, which covers 30% of the installation cost, will end June 30, 2026. Separately, the Trump administration has also frozen funding to build high-speed EV chargers on highways, a move that some states are currently challenging in court . Some local utility companies offer incentives for technologies like heat pumps, residential solar, or insulation, so experts suggest checking in with your local utility. The country's major climate legislation in 2022 gave more than $8.5 billion to states, including Arizona, Georgia, New York and Wisconsin, to help them expand or establish rebate programs for home green technology upgrades. Much of that money is still available. Rewiring America and another nonprofit called The Switch is On have online tools that can help people, in most states, plug in their ZIP codes and incomes to search for the federal, state, local and utility company incentives for which they're qualified. Consumers can also check for incentives at an online database from the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center . Still, because a lot of state rebate money is tied to Biden-era policies, experts also suggest looking into those sooner rather than later. Lowell Ungar , head of federal policy at The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization, doesn't think most states will run out of rebate money this year, but he adds, ""eventually they will run out of money and then there won't be any further federal help."""

Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images hide caption A search and rescue team looks for people along the Guadalupe River near a damaged building at Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas. It's not just Texas. In the past couple of weeks, communities all around the country have been hit with torrential rains and deadly flash flooding. Extreme weather events like this are expected to become more common as the planet heats up. As climate change increases flash flooding risks, our infrastructure is struggling to keep up. But improvements to that infrastructure will cost billions. NPR's Michael Copley explains how a changing climate drives flooding and how communities and individuals can prepare. And NPR's Laura Sullivan reports on how flood maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency didn't capture the true risks at Camp Mystic, which was devastated by the Texas flooding.

climate,"Workers on scaffolding repaint the NASA logo near the top of the Vehicle Assembly Building in 2020 at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. John Raoux/AP hide caption The Trump administration on Monday took another step to make it harder to find major, legally mandated scientific assessments of how climate change is endangering the nation and its people. Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark. Such sites tell state and local governments and the public what to expect in their backyards from a warming world and how best to adapt to it. At the time, the White House said NASA would house the reports to comply with a 1990 law that requires the reports, which the space agency said it planned to do. But on Monday, NASA announced that it aborted those plans. ""The USGCRP (the government agency that oversees and used to host the report) met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress. NASA has no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov's data,"" NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens said in an email. That means no data from the assessment or the government science office that coordinated the work will be on NASA, she said. On July 3, NASA put out a statement that said, ""All preexisting reports will be hosted on the NASA website, ensuring continuity of reporting."" ""This document was written for the American people, paid for by the taxpayers, and it contains vital information we need to keep ourselves safe in a changing climate, as the disasters that continue to mount demonstrate so tragically and clearly,"" said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. She is chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of several past national climate assessments. Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's library and the latest report and its interactive atlas can be seen here . Former Obama White House science adviser and climate scientist John Holdren accused the administration of outright lying and long intended to censor or bury the reports. ""The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,"" Holdren said. ""In this instance, the administration offers a modest consolation to quell initial outrage over the closure of the globalchange.gov site and the disappearance of the National Climate Assessments. Then, two weeks later, they snatch away the consolation with no apology."" ""They simply don't want the public to see the meticulously assembled and scientifically validated information about what climate change is already doing to our farms, forests, and fisheries, as well as to storms, floods, wildfires, and coast property — and about how all those damages will grow in the absence of concerted remedial action,"" Holdren said in an email. That's why it's important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said. He said they are written in a way that is ""useful to people who need to understand what climate change is doing and will do to THEM, their loved ones, their property and their environment."" ""Trump doesn't want people to know,"" Holdren wrote.

Global warming is driving dangerous and disruptive flooding in underground rail systems around the world. Flooded tunnels and stations have disrupted service and stranded passengers in Boston, London, San Francisco, Taipei, Bangkok, Washington, D.C., and a host of other cities in recent years. But the problem has taken on added urgency this summer, with multiple, high-profile subway floods driven by summer rainstorms. Overnight, the remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded much of the New York City subway. Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a travel ban and warned residents to ""stay off subways"" as up to 10 inches of rain fell in some parts of the region in a matter of hours. It is the third time New York's subways have flooded this summer and the first time the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency warning for the city. Heavy rain has also repeatedly swamped underground tracks in Boston . Our infrastructure is not ready for climate change, a thread from tonight. 28th St. subway station pic.twitter.com/uYemJKB8yg Elsewhere, subway floods have turned deadly. In July, 13 passengers died in Zhengzhou, China, after flash floods trapped them. Harrowing videos showed people struggling to breathe a shrinking pocket of air as the water rose. ""None of us had seen people with water up to their necks, standing in underground trains,"" says Slobodan Djordjevic, an engineer at the University of Exeter who specializes in flooding of underground train systems. Djordjevic has spent much of his career studying floods in subway tunnels. But he says what he saw happening in China shocked him. ""I actually considered whether this was even real."" In China and around the world, the culprit is climate-driven torrential rain. Zhengzhou received about a year's worth of precipitation in just one day. Earlier this summer, the remnants of a tropical storm dumped a month's worth of rain on New York City in the span of an afternoon. Dozens of subway systems around the world have experienced flooding, Djordjevic says, and he estimates it's likely hundreds of thousands of passengers have been directly affected. That has created tension between the need to provide reliable, low-emissions mass transit options and the growing cost of maintaining underground transit in a wetter world. Keeping water out of tunnels and stations is expensive, especially in places with aging, leaky subways built for a 20th century climate. Some help could come from the federal government. The infrastructure bill moving through Congress allocates $66 billion for rail — a huge infusion of cash that could help fund retrofitting of old subway systems to keep water out and the building of new train lines in places that currently depend on cars. ""Every city should have a comprehensive review of flood risk for the underground system,"" Djordjevic says. ""Looking ahead, authorities need to think very carefully about where they want to build new lines, new stations, new tunnels."" Many U.S. cities are a decade or more into adapting their subway systems to a wetter climate. In Boston , the transit authority has started waterproofing stations and protecting tracks that are vulnerable to sea level rise. After Hurricane Sandy flooded miles of subway tunnels, New York poured millions of dollars into flood control for the nation's largest underground rail system. In Washington, the transit authority has spent millions of dollars waterproofing leaky tunnels and plans to spend even more to keep water out of vents and station entrances. ""We are investing more in water mitigation today than we ever have,"" says Andy Off, executive vice president of capital delivery for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The authority also has an emergency flood response. A unit tracks inclement weather so that flooding hot spots can be monitored and workers can put out sandbags and check underground pump stations before the water arrives. But keeping the water out is a constant battle. Much of Washington metro system was built nearly 50 years ago, and the subways in New York and Boston are even older. Air vents are flush with the sidewalk or street, which makes it easy for water to flow in. Many station entrances are in low-lying places or are constructed in ways that funnel water from the street down stairs or escalators. ""Older systems were designed for the climate of the past,"" says Tina Hodges, a former analyst at the Federal Transit Administration who wrote a 2011 report about climate risks to public transit in the United States. ""In the Northeastern United States, which is home to some of the oldest and largest transit systems in the country, there's already been a 67% increase in the heaviest precipitation."" The same is true in many European cities, including London and Berlin. In recent years, passengers have captured strikingly similar videos of water cascading into subway stations in cities thousands of miles apart. Newer subway systems in flood-prone parts of Asia may offer clues about how to adapt. As this summer's disaster in Zhengzhou made clear, Asian cities are on the front lines of climate-driven subway flooding. And the fact that those newer systems are often better protected from flooding and fatalities underscores the urgency of adaptation. Water runs down the steps of a subway station in Berlin in 2019. Cities in the U.S. and Europe are racing to waterproof older subway systems as climate change drives more rain. Fabian Fuchs/picture alliance via Getty Images hide caption ""There's a lot to learn from Asian cities, ways to deal with flooding of underground trains,"" Djordjevic says. For example, in Taipei, where flooding from cyclones is common, Taiwanese authorities raised the entrances to stations to keep water out. In Kyoto, Japan, researchers built a full-scale model of a subway station escalator and simulated a flash flood to see how much water people could safely walk through and to help create emergency plans for closing stations during storms. Bangkok has long had a flood warning system to keep passengers safe, although the city has struggled to prevent underground train flooding. Many subway systems in Asia were also built more recently than their counterparts in the U.S. and Europe, so they are better-suited to the current climate, Djordjevic says. In the U.S., larger cities are generally doing a better job adapting to and preparing for transit flooding than smaller ones because they have more resources, Hodges says. For example, large transit departments increasingly employ resilience experts who work full time on adaptation and can also collaborate with climate scientists and engineers to come up with solutions that protect trains and passengers from flooding. Smaller cities are less likely to have such resources. ""There are definitely barriers to adapting to climate change, one of which is that it's just difficult to interpret the information that comes in from climate scientists into actionable information that planners and engineers can use,"" Hodges says.

Heavy rain from remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded much of the city's subway system. Authorities issued a travel ban and warned residents to avoid stations. The benefits of underground trains still outweigh the costs for many cities. Since Hurricane Sandy, New York has pressed forward with subway line expansions. San Francisco is expanding its subway, even as the system faces flooding from sea level rise. Fort Lauderdale, Fla., one of the most flood-prone places in the country, is considering a new underground train line that would reduce car traffic and allow residents to commute into the downtown area by train. Investing in new underground infrastructure in a city known as the ""Venice of America"" has raised some eyebrows. The editorial board of the city's paper spoke out against the plan and argued that the train should cross a major river in the city via a bridge, rather than a tunnel. But while Mayor Dean Trantalis acknowledges that climate-driven flooding is a worry in his city, he dismisses concerns about train tunnel flooding. ""If you put in the proper pump stations and the proper technology to anticipate heavy rainfalls and things like that — I've lived in Fort Lauderdale for almost 40 years, and I've never once seen our tunnel flooded,"" he says. And keeping the train underground will alleviate traffic congestion caused by railroad crossings, Trantalis says. Experts say it's important that new infrastructure take into account the costs of maintenance and the climate of the future. Sea level rise is accelerating in many places, including Florida. If new train systems are designed to last 30 years or more, they will need to withstand dramatically higher tides as well as more frequent and severe storms. ""When it comes to coastal areas or parts of Florida, sooner or later sea level rise will lead to some areas that need to be abandoned or protected at a very, very high cost,"" Djordjevic says. ""So those decisions would need to be looked at very carefully."""
