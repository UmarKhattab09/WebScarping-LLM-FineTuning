0,politics,"President Trump meets with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Oval Office at the White House on July 22. During a question-and-answer session with reporters while at the meeting, Trump railed against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption The Justice Department on Tuesday said it is in touch with an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , to try to arrange a meeting with her in the coming days. President Trump said he thought the development ""sounds appropriate,"" though he also claimed to know nothing about it. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the plan on social media, saying that the department is seeking any information from Maxwell — who is serving time for sex trafficking — as part of its quest to uncover ""all credible evidence"" in the Epstein case. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, is facing a backlash from supporters who want more information released about the disgraced financier's crimes and his 2019 death by suicide in prison. Trump has dismissed the uproar as a politically driven ""witch hunt"" distracting from his agenda. Asked about the newest development on Tuesday, he told reporters, ""I don't really follow that too much."" His comments to reporters came while he was meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines on trade issues. After the meeting, Trump announced on social media that importers of goods from the Philippines will face a 19% tariff , while U.S. exports to the country will face no tariffs. Trump spent most of his time in the Oval Office question-and-answer session railing against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, recently published materials that she claims show that Obama officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ""It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. So you ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,"" Trump told reporters — the ""nonsense"" referring to the Epstein controversy. Trump said it was ""time to go after people"" in connection to his allegations about the 2016 election. Obama's office issued a rare response, calling Trump's statements ""outrageous"" and noting that conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election had been widely accepted. ""These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in the statement. Republicans in Congress have also been grappling with the Epstein issue. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced Tuesday that the House would finish work a day early, canceling votes scheduled for later in the week. That means members will leave town for an annual August recess without a fresh confrontation over Epstein. The schedule change was announced after repeated clashes among Republicans about the files, including a deadlock in the powerful House Rules Committee over an effort by Democrats to force additional votes on the Epstein matter.

1,politics,"There is an ongoing staffing crunch at the Social Security Administration. Here is one of the agency's field offices, on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption The Social Security Administration (SSA) recently reassigned a small share of its field office employees in an effort to bring down lengthy wait times for the agency's national 800 phone number. Workers at local offices across the country say these reassignments have been disruptive for staff and are increasing wait times for other services. Experts say the tradeoff is a byproduct of a declining Social Security workforce dealing with thousands more Americans who qualify for benefits every day. Thousands of employees have left the government agency in recent months. ""They are in a deep hole of their own creation on staffing and so you just don't have enough people to go around to serve the public,"" said Kathleen Romig, a former SSA official who's now director of Social Security and disability policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). ""And so all you can really do at this point is rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic."" Earlier this month, about 4% of front-line workers were temporarily reassigned to cover the national 800 number, according to the SSA, which added that phone service has improved as a result. ""Thanks to a new telephone platform, most callers are now served quickly through callbacks or automated options, and answer times have already improved significantly in field offices,"" the agency said in a statement to NPR. ""By temporarily assigning a small percentage of field office staff to assist with 800 number calls, we can improve the 800 [number] average speed of answer without disrupting local services."" But Nicole Morio, a field office worker in Staten Island and union representative, said these reassignments have forced front-line staff to take on more work. ""The stress level is probably at a maximum for everyone,"" Morio said. ""At one point I think we were doing the work of 1.8 people. Now it seems as though we're doing the work of 10 to 15."" Monique Buchanan, president of an American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) chapter that represents teleservice center workers, told NPR that the agency has also started to reassign vital claims specialists to the 800 number. Buchanan, who works at a field office in Detroit, said temporarily removing claims specialists from front-line positions is ""directly harmful to the public."" She said these workers finalize applications for people seeking help accessing benefits, such as payments for disabled children. ""These applications are taken through an interview that the claim specialist engages in,"" she said. ""So, the start is the interview with the claims specialist."" CBPP's Romig said staffing up the national hotline might not actually be faster for beneficiaries because so much work is done by claim specialists and other staff at field offices. ""Often customers can't actually complete their business on the phone,"" she said. ""They are going to have to end up in a field office ultimately anyway, or a field office employee is going to have to process that claim that has been taken on the phone or resolve the problem that has been raised on the phone."" The agency recently touted that it had reduced the average answering speed on the 800 number to ""13 minutes, a 35 percent reduction compared to this time last year and over a 50 percent reduction compared to last year's annual average."" But experts say it's harder to track whether the agency is doing better in other metrics. Recently the agency took down various real-time metrics from its website. Romig said it's possible wait times are decreasing as more people are transferred to 800-number duty, but it will surely come at the expense of other vital services. ""Sure, you can get a boost in a particular metric like phone hold times by making a massive shift of staffers to answer the phones,"" she said. ""But you do that by creating a new hole in the field offices, and that's what they're doing."" A Social Security Administration office on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption Morio, the Staten Island employee, believes she and other field office workers are being ""prevented"" from properly serving the people who need their help. ""We can't complete all of the things that need to be done,"" she said. ""When you have so little employees and so much work — it's stressful because we get hired to help the claimants. We get hired to help the American public. We're public servants. That's what we do."" Policy experts and front-line workers say that lowering wait times for phone services is a worthy goal, but it cannot be achieved without hiring more staff. Romig said staffing levels at Social Security were already at a decades-long low before the Trump administration began urging people to resign or retire early. According to agency officials, roughly 4,600 employees have left since March. Romig cautioned that staffing ""numbers are very hard to pin down"" because resignations are constantly ""in flux,"" due to the administration's deferred resignation program and ongoing early retirements. During a congressional hearing last month, new SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano told members he does not believe increasing staffing is necessary to improve the agency's services. ""I do agree we must perform significantly better,"" he said, ""but increased staffing is not the long-term solution."" But Jessica LaPointe, who works at a field office in Madison, Wis., and is the president of the local AFGE chapter that represents 25,000 field office workers, said the shuffling of staffing is prompting even more people to leave the agency. ""If they decided not to take the buyout incentives that were offered in March, then now they're just leaving to save their mental health as their work keeps piling up,"" LaPointe said. ""It really is a manufactured crisis as a result of past changes that just continue to just make everything worse, sadly."" Some local field offices only have a few employees, so the loss of one can have a big impact. Juan Daniel Vasquez, who is a generalist technical expert in a field office in Monroe, Mich., said his office had an employee who covered the phones who was recently shifted to the 800 number. He said that since then, all the staff have been tasked with covering the phones, which has added a significant amount of work to everyone's plate. ""It's a lot tougher,"" Vasquez said. ""I'm nearing retirement age and … if you had asked me last year, I would have said I want to stay another five to seven years. Now I'm looking at one to two."" The agency told NPR that Bisignano has been ""visiting field offices and processing centers to hear directly from front-line employees,"" since his confirmation hearing. ""He is committed to giving SSA employees the tools they need to provide best-in-class customer service to the American public and succeed in their roles,"" the agency said in a statement. ""SSA monitors all workload measures in the field offices that are helping answer the 800 Number calls. In addition, we have established field office support units to assist with critical workloads and demands."" But LaPointe said that working conditions for field office workers in the past few months have only gotten worse. ""There's no indication that this is getting better,"" she said. ""We have an agency not listening to the workers.""",Critical

3,science,"Newborn babies lie in bassinets in the nursery of a postpartum recovery center in upstate New York in 2017. A new study examined births over decades to find tendencies toward having all girls or all boys. Seth Wenig/AP hide caption Couples who've been surprised by a string of baby boys or baby girls could be forgiven for wondering whether the odds in the offspring lottery are more than just pure chance. A new study by Harvard University researchers that examines the birthing records of 58,007 women suggests their hunch might be correct. The authors of the study, published in the journal Science Advances last week , found that instead of straight 50/50 odds between boys and girls with each birth, the offspring in families with at least three children tend to follow what scientists call a ""weighted coin toss,"" indicating that each family may have a distinct tendency toward girls or boys. ""We're seeing a lot of us having only boys or girls,"" says Siwen Wang, a doctoral student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the lead author in the study. That led her and colleagues to wonder ""whether it's simply by chance, or is there any underlying biology explaining these sex clustering within families?"" They analyzed data from the second and third iteration of the Nurses' Health Study , which tracked just over 146,000 pregnancies across the U.S. from 1956 to 2015. They found that if the first two children born in a family are girls, the chances of the third child also being a girl are higher than for a boy — and this pattern continues with subsequent children. The same holds true if the first two are boys: The likelihood of having another boy increases, and the trend persists through later births. ""Notably, in families with three boys (MMM), the probability of having another boy was 61%; in families with three girls (FFF), the probability of having another girl was 58%,"" the study authors wrote. Looking for a possible explanation, ""one of the things that stands out is age at first birth — that's associated with a moderately higher chance of having only boys or girls,"" Wang says. ""If you're starting your family younger than 23 ... [there is] around a 40% chance of having a same-sex family,"" she says. If the woman begins having children after age 28, it's around 50% — a relatively small but statistically significant difference. The researchers excluded families with only one child and pregnancies ending in miscarriage, stillbirth or twins. Women with a history of infertility treatments were also left out of the study. To avoid bias from parents who stopped having children after reaching a preferred sex ratio, the researchers did not count each woman's final birth in the analysis. The researchers speculate that in older women, shorter menstrual cycles could factor into the results and that changes in vaginal acidity might favor the survival of sperm carrying either the Y (boys) or X (girls) chromosome. However, they note that because maternal and paternal ages are often correlated, the father's age might also play a role. Since the study included only women, the authors emphasize that the exact mechanism remains uncertain. ""We don't have data about the dad,"" Wang says. ""We don't have data about his genetics or even very precise characteristics ... which is obviously important for sex determination."" It's a concern also raised by Mark Gerstein, a professor at Yale University who wasn't involved in the research. Gerstein specializes in applying computational approaches to molecular biology. ""Given the disparity observed for mothers in the study, one could easily envision an equally impactful relationship with either the genetics or age of the father,"" he says. ""This seems like a promising area for future research to explore."" Ralph Catalano, an emeritus professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, who also wasn't involved in the research, thinks that the study's narrow focus on sex at birth may not show the full picture. ""Fewer than 50% of conceptions reach birth. More than 50% are spontaneously aborted [miscarried], and that's not a random draw,"" he says. Due to immunological and developmental sensitivity, females are more likely to be spontaneously aborted early in pregnancy, while males are more vulnerable to spontaneous abortion later in pregnancy because they are physically frailer, he says. ""The sex of infants we see — those who make it to birth — is shaped as much by in utero selection as by sex at conception,"" he says. Another caveat is the composition of the sample. The Nurses' Health Study that the sample was drawn from is made up of overwhelmingly white women residing in the United States. ""Since sex preferences and reproductive behaviors vary across cultures, religions, or countries … the sex ratio distribution pattern observed in our study may not apply to other societies,"" the researchers acknowledge.",High
4,health,"Anopheles mosquito, Culicidae. De Agostini Editorial/via Getty Images hide caption Each year, 263 million people get malaria. But from the parasite's perspective, infecting humans is harder than you might think, and requires completing an epic journey within the tiny body of a mosquito. First, the mosquito must suck the blood of an individual infected with malaria — bringing the Plasmodium parasite into the insect's gut. Then the parasite must travel to the critter's salivary glands, where it's poised to be injected into the mosquito's next victim via a bite. Now a team of researchers have found a way to interrupt this crucial journey. By using gene editing to make a tiny tweak to the mosquito's genome — one that changes just a single amino acid — parasites were largely prevented from reaching their final destination. The change effectively rendered laboratory mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria , researchers report Wednesday in Nature. ""The idea that you could change just one amino acid and not have the parasite transmitted is a pretty big deal,"" says Fred Gould , an entomologist at North Carolina State University who wasn't involved in the study. ""It's really exciting."" That tiny tweak could be spread through a whole mosquito population using a gene drive, a genetic technology that breaks the normal 50-50 rules of inheritance. Gene drives are sequences of DNA that can be inserted into the genome of an individual and cause a specific mutation or gene to be passed on to virtually all offspring, instead of just 50%. Eventually, researchers hope to engineer mosquitoes with this approach and release them into the wild. ""These mosquitoes will spread on their own and gradually transform the malaria-transmitting mosquito population to one that cannot transmit malaria,"" says George Dimopoulos , a biologist at Johns Hopkins University and study co-author. Dimopoulos isn't claiming this technique will be the final nail in malaria's coffin, and it's far from being ready for release. It'll likely be several years, at least, before field tests, and will require buy-in and approval by local communities and governments. But he argues new genetic tools are needed to quash the disease, since existing ones like bed nets and antimalarial drugs haven't been able to turn malaria — which kills 600,000 a year — into a disease of the past. But gene drive technology is controversial. ""Gene drives could have far-reaching, unpredictable negative consequences,"" says Dana Perls , senior program manager on emerging technologies at Friends of the Earth, an environmental non-profit. Because they distort normal patterns of inheritance, ""the genetic changes from a gene drive to a population of mosquitoes are very likely to persist for a long time, possibly permanently."" Critics worry that gene drives designed to spread one tiny change to the genome could end up mutating to affect other parts of the genome. That could result in unanticipated changes spreading fast through a population before researchers would have a chance to stop it, potentially upending the delicate balance of an ecosystem. Still, researchers are exploring several gene editing strategies. Some aim to suppress mosquito populations by rendering individuals infertile. But there are worries that wiping out mosquitoes could have unintended consequences for ecosystems — for example by removing a food source for birds and bats. Another strategy is to engineer mosquitoes with new genes that would make proteins that mess with the parasite itself, curbing transmission without harming the bugs. Dimopoulos and his colleagues wanted to take a different approach, one that messed with the parasite, but without adding an entirely new gene. They settled on a gene called FREP1 . It helps mosquitoes feed on blood. But it also appears to be important to the parasites, which use it to complete their crucial journey to the salivary glands in ways researchers don't fully understand. Some mosquitoes have a small genetic change that seems to disrupt this journey. The researchers used CRISPR, a gene editing technology that can very precisely change the genome, to create two nearly-identical Anopheles stephensi groups, one with the normal FREP1 gene and one with the variant. The variant is very small, changing just one amino acid, the basic building blocks of proteins. But that small change had big effects. Mosquitoes with the edited variant have about 5 times fewer infective parasites in the salivary glands, a median of zero compared with thousands in non-edited mosquitoes. There were significantly fewer parasites in the gut, too. Otherwise, the insects appeared perfectly healthy. It's unclear exactly how much this genetic tweak would impair a mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. But previous research suggests ""something on the order of a 90% reduction in malaria transmission would be more or less what you'd expect,"" says Ethan Bier , a geneticist at the University of California San Diego and study co-author. ""I was surprised myself that a single amino acid change could do that."" Next, the researchers showed that they could rapidly spread this beneficial change with a gene drive. It took just 10 generations for the variant to spread to over 90% of their laboratory population. ""It's really excellent work,"" says Anthony James , a molecular biologist at the University of California Irvine who wasn't involved in the study, but works on introducing new resistance genes to mosquitoes. Since the change is naturally occurring, he says it could be ""marginally more acceptable"" to people wary of genetic engineering. ""It's good to have more than one approach available,"" he says. That's especially important if the malaria parasite evolves resistance against these new tools.",Critical

6,business,"President Trump answering questions at the White House on July 11, 2025. Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption The Trump administration on Wednesday stepped up its attacks on ""woke"" artificial intelligence systems, a move propelled by the belief among some conservatives that AI models have drifted too far to the left. ""In order for all Americans to adopt and realize the benefits of AI, these systems must be built to reflect truth and objectivity, not top-down ideological bias,"" said Michael Kratsios, who leads the administration's office of science and technology policy, on a call with reporters on Wednesday. The Trump administration says more actions are expected on the ""woke"" AI issue, including an executive order later Wednesday. The White House is planning to revise Biden-era federal guidelines for AI safety to remove references to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change and misinformation, according to the Trump administration's AI action plan. And soon, the federal government will only do work with tech firms ""who ensure that their systems allow for free speech and expression to flourish,"" Kratsios said on the briefing call, echoing language from the administration's policy documents instructing tech companies to rid AI models of liberal bias. It is the latest instance of the Trump administration turning the screws on DEI initiatives and railing against popular AI chatbots. Trump supporters have increasingly criticized the technology, saying safety guardrails end up censoring conservative views. ""The AI industry is deeply concerned about this situation,"" said Neil Sahota, a technologist who advises the United Nations on artificial intelligence issues. ""They're already in a global arms race with AI, and now they're being asked to put some very nebulous measures in place to undo protections because they might be seen as woke,"" he said. ""It's freaking tech companies out."" One possible way AI companies could respond, according to Sahota, is to unveil ""anti-woke"" versions of their chatbots with fewer safeguards in order to land the lucrative business of the federal government. ""If you're a tech company with a lot of government contracts, this order is a sticky wicket,"" Sahota said. While some studies have shown that popular chatbots can at times deliver left-of-center responses to certain policy questions, experts say it can often come down to how a question is framed, or what part of the internet the system is summarizing. AI scholars say there is no proof that any major chatbot has been intentionally designed to generate liberal answers and censor conservative views. ""Often what is happening with these criticisms is that a chatbot doesn't align with someone's respective viewpoint, so they want to place the blame on the model,"" said Chinasa Okolo, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, DC. Turning ""woke AI"" into a rallying cry has parallels to a previous conservative battering ram against Silicon Valley: the belief that content guidelines on social media platforms were devised to muzzle right-wing perspectives. Last year, the howls over chatbots being ""woke"" intensified when Google's Gemini image generator depicted Black and Asian men as being U.S. founding fathers and Vikings as being ethnically diverse. Google executives apologized, and the company explained Gemini had overcorrected for diversity, including ""cases that should clearly not show a range."" Developing policies to counter such episodes has become a focus for White House AI czar David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, a senior policy advisor in the Trump administration. It is a striking reversal from how the Biden administration approached the technology, when officials sought ways to enact barriers against AI perpetuating bias and potentially violating peoples' civil rights. Now, new energy has been breathed into making AI a part of the larger culture wars. Conservative activists seized on the Google Gemini snafu, but when Elon Musk's Grok chatbot flew off the rails earlier this month and launched into antisemitic tirades, few right-wing commentators responded. Just days later, the maker of Grok, Musk's xAI, was awarded a Defense Department contract worth up to $200 million , along with Google, Anthropic and OpenAI. ""Musk's original vision for xAI was a sort of 'anti-woke AI,' but when you control poorly for data quality and disable safeguards, you get things like the recent Nazi episode,"" said Talia Ringer, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. xAI blamed outdated software code on the meltdown. In particular, instructions that told Grok to be ""maximally based,"" a slang term for holding strong opinions even if they are troubling, which was reinforced by a similar instruction given to the chatbot: ""You tell like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct."" The company said the issue has been fixed. Most popular chatbots have protections against things like slurs, harassment and hate speech, basic guardrails that may now be under new scrutiny by the Trump administration. ""Most of the examples I've seen conservatives cite of AI being too 'woke' are LLMs refusing to confirm conspiracy theories or racist claims,"" said Ringer, using the abbreviation for large language models, which underpin chatbot technology. To Okolo at the Brookings Institution, the battle over whether chatbots perpetuate left- or right-leaning views is overshadowed by another fight over the acceptance of provable facts. ""Some people, unfortunately, believe that basic facts with scientific basis are left-leaning, or 'woke,' and this does skew their perceptions a bit,"" she said. Doing the work of changing AI systems to respond to the White House executive order will be messy, said technologist Sahota, because where lines are drawn, and why, can initiate all sorts of political and cultural firestorms. ""What is even politically-driven? In this day and age, if someone says something about the importance of vaccination for measles, is that now a politically charged discussion?"" he said. ""But if there's potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in future federal contracts on the line, companies might have to do something, or they could be putting a serious amount of revenue in jeopardy.""",High
7,business,"A 2023 Model X sports-utility vehicle sits outside a Tesla dealership Sunday, June 18, 2023, in Englewood, Colo. David Zalubowski/AP hide caption Tesla on Wednesday reported a drop in its profit during the second quarter, as the electric vehicle maker continues to struggle despite CEO Elon Musk's pivot back to focusing on his companies after his controversial role leading the Trump administration's government cost cutting efforts. The company's electric vehicle sales have been flagging, and earlier this month it reported a drop of 13.5% in the quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. On Wednesday, Tesla said its net income also suffered, slumping 16% year-on-year. That paled in comparison to the 71% drop in year-on-year profits the company reported during the first quarter, when sales were down 13%. Tesla will hold a call with investors tonight to discuss the report, which highlighted Tesla's other ventures, calling this quarter ""a seminal point in Tesla's history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services."" The company rolled out the first iteration of its robotaxi service in Austin in June, and the earnings report said the company's approach to the service would allow for rapid scaling and improved profitability. The company is also developing a humanoid robot called Optimus . During the second quarter, Tesla's total automotive revenue slipped 16% while energy generation and storage revenue was off 7%. Services and other revenue grew by 17%. Onlookers have blamed Tesla's flagging car sales on Musk's political activity , although during the previous quarter's call he said he didn't see ""any reduction in demand"" and, without evidence, dismissed protests against his company as ""paid for."" Surveys have found that the company's brand reputation has taken a serious hit , particularly among liberal or Democratic car shoppers — who tend to be more likely, at least right now, to shop for an electric vehicle. Musk has stepped away from his leadership of DOGE and had a very public split with Donald Trump , but he remains interested in politics, recently floating the idea of launching a third party. Another likely factor is increased competition among EV makers. In the U.S., the traditional automakers — who have lagged far behind Tesla on electric vehicles — are gradually eating into Tesla's market dominance. According to the latest data from Cox, Tesla accounts for 46.2% of EV sales in the U.S.; that figure used to be nearly 80%. GM now controls 13% of that market. Globally, meanwhile, Chinese EV makers are ascendent . Tesla, which has long been known for a high rate of executive turnover, lost three senior leaders in the last two months. The company also worried investors earlier this month when it failed to announce its annual shareholder meeting. Tesla is incorporated in Texas, where state law requires the company to hold the meeting within 13 months of the previous one. That meant a deadline of July 13. On July 9, with no word from Tesla about the meeting, a group of large shareholders sent Tesla's board a letter raising concerns about the oversight. One day later, the company announced it was pushing its annual meeting back to November . Tesla's share price ticked down slightly in after-hours trading following the news.",High

After years of lobbying by vulnerable island nations who fear they could disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice in 2023 for an advisory opinion, a non-binding but important basis for international obligations. A panel of 15 judges was tasked with answering two questions. First, what are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? Second, what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? ""The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,"" Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney general of the island nation of Vanuatu, told the court during a week of hearings in December. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis but it affects many more island nations in the South Pacific. ""The agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough,"" Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister for climate change, told The Associated Press. Any decision by The Hague-based court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol, since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. ""What makes this case so important is that it addresses the past, present, and future of climate action. It's not just about future targets -- it also tackles historical responsibility, because we cannot solve the climate crisis without confronting its roots,"" Joie Chowdhury, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, told AP. Activists could bring lawsuits against their own countries for failing to comply with the decision and states could return to the International Court of Justice to hold each other to account. And whatever the judges say will be used as the basis for other legal instruments, like investment agreements, Chowdhury said. The United States and Russia, both of whom are major petroleum-producing states, are staunchly opposed to the court mandating emissions reductions. Simply having the court issue an opinion is the latest in a series of legal victories for the small island nations. Earlier this month, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found that countries have a legal duty not only to avoid environmental harm but also to protect and restore ecosystems. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change. In 2019, the Netherlands' Supreme court handed down the first major legal win for climate activists when judges ruled that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change was a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens.",High
9,climate,"Experts say there are key questions parents and guardians should ask camp operators about wildfires, flood and heat risk. Danielle Villasana for The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption The deaths of at least 27 children and staff at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas have some parents and guardians questioning the safety of summer camps, especially as global warming increases risks of extreme weather. Part of summer camp's allure is that children are outside in nature. But that can also raise the possibility of heat illness and risks from greater proximity to wildfire or flood-prone areas, says Tracey Gaslin,  chief executive of the nonprofit Alliance for Camp Health in Kentucky. Outside of regulations that apply to all businesses, there are no federal standards that are specific to camps, says Henry DeHart, interim chief executive of the American Camp Association (ACA). The ACA has a national accreditation program that includes some health and safety standards, but it's voluntary and only about 12% of the country's roughly 20,000 camps have participated, he says. On the state level, DeHart says some state agencies conduct camp health and safety inspections. But oversight and protections vary considerably from state to state, and some states have very little regulation. ""There are a lot of states that have very little or no regulation related to camp,"" DeHart says. ""The regulatory framework is wide and varied and, in some places, it's not very robust."" Because of the gaps in the current regulatory framework, some experts on climate-related risks say parents and guardians should ask more detailed questions about campers' safety. Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers , dropped off his 8-year-old daughter at Girl Scout Camp earlier this month, and realized he, too, had many more questions about his daughter's camp's flood precautions. ""Even as a floodplain manager,"" he says, ""I don't think I even had appreciation for what, as a parent, I should be thinking about when sending kids to camp."" Now, Berginnis has a list of points to cover. For parents or guardians sending children to any kind of camp, here are the top questions experts say you should be asking about increased risks of heat, wildfires and floods. Camps can be great for kids, but can also expose them to heat. Children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies. Serhii Bezrukyi/Getty Images hide caption This question is important because heat-related illness and death are major and growing risks in the U.S. —and that threat is often underestimated. Also, children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies, says Rupa Basu,  senior science advisor for the University of California, San Francisco Center for Climate Health and Equity . That makes them more at risk for heat illness, she says. ""I  think that people don't even think of children often as being high risk populations,"" Basu says. "" But they absolutely are."" For these reasons, Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health thinks parents and guardians should be asking camps how they are thinking about heat and hydration. She suggests parents and guardians ask about how the camp's physical site is designed. "" Do you have things like shade structures? Misting systems?"" Gaslin says. ""A really solid infrastructure build is important."" Gaslin also thinks parents and guardians should be asking about how ""climate-aware"" the campers' schedules are. That can look like an activity in a cool location, then an activity outside in a warmer location, then back into the cool, she says. Also it's important to ask about how frequently counselors are reminding campers to hydrate. ""It's really about giving conscious thought to how do we manage that impact of heat,"" she says. "" If we're gonna be outdoors, guess what? Water activities are a great thing to do."" Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP hide caption This question is key because many camps are located in flood-prone areas, Berginnis says. He says – in many ways – that's understandable. ""To me, it makes logical sense that you'd have a lot of camps there because it has really interesting habitats. It has interesting animals and geology and everything, and kids can learn a lot there,"" Berginnis says. But he thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Berginnis says adults can look up risks on this FEMA website . Parents and guardians can also plug in addresses to this database from First Street , a climate risk modeling company. If it's a sleep-away camp, Berginnis says it's important to ask where the kids' sleeping quarters are located. ""If it's an overnight camp, any kind of residential lodging overnight for the kids, if it's in a floodway, that should be a huge red flag right there,"" he says. And he says parents and guardians should ask camps about things like flood sirens and specifics of emergency action plans. "" I would be very blunt with a campground: I wanna know the procedure. If a flash flood warning is declared for the area, what does the camp do? What do the counselors do? So that they can talk it through with you,"" he says in an email. ""Do not be satisfied with a generic answer like 'we have an emergency action plan'. Ask them about specific actions like is there anyone monitoring the weather at night? What are the designated evacuation areas? And if they cannot talk that through with you, again, I would say, that's another red flag."" Tracey Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health says parents and guardians should make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images hide caption As with flood risks, parents and guardians should be asking about emergency action plans and preparedness for wildfire and smoke, Gaslin says. ""Parents can ask camps, do they monitor air quality?"" she says, ""What's their evacuation plan? How are they gonna communicate with families? So families are gonna be able to say, in a moment of crisis, I wanna be able to communicate with you in some way."" Gaslin says it's important to make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Gaslin says parents and guardians should make sure there are always staff monitoring the weather, and at sleepaway camps there should be a solid communication system so at night, individuals are alerted to environmental changes or concerns. That means at least some staff with cell phones and radios at all hours, to monitor for wildfire risk, flash floods, or any other hazards.",Critical
