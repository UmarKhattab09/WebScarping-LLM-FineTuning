politics,"President Trump meets with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Oval Office at the White House on July 22. During a question-and-answer session with reporters while at the meeting, Trump railed against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption The Justice Department on Tuesday said it is in touch with an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , to try to arrange a meeting with her in the coming days. President Trump said he thought the development ""sounds appropriate,"" though he also claimed to know nothing about it. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the plan on social media, saying that the department is seeking any information from Maxwell — who is serving time for sex trafficking — as part of its quest to uncover ""all credible evidence"" in the Epstein case. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, is facing a backlash from supporters who want more information released about the disgraced financier's crimes and his 2019 death by suicide in prison. Trump has dismissed the uproar as a politically driven ""witch hunt"" distracting from his agenda. Asked about the newest development on Tuesday, he told reporters, ""I don't really follow that too much."" His comments to reporters came while he was meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines on trade issues. After the meeting, Trump announced on social media that importers of goods from the Philippines will face a 19% tariff , while U.S. exports to the country will face no tariffs. Trump spent most of his time in the Oval Office question-and-answer session railing against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, recently published materials that she claims show that Obama officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ""It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. So you ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,"" Trump told reporters — the ""nonsense"" referring to the Epstein controversy. Trump said it was ""time to go after people"" in connection to his allegations about the 2016 election. Obama's office issued a rare response, calling Trump's statements ""outrageous"" and noting that conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election had been widely accepted. ""These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in the statement. Republicans in Congress have also been grappling with the Epstein issue. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced Tuesday that the House would finish work a day early, canceling votes scheduled for later in the week. That means members will leave town for an annual August recess without a fresh confrontation over Epstein. The schedule change was announced after repeated clashes among Republicans about the files, including a deadlock in the powerful House Rules Committee over an effort by Democrats to force additional votes on the Epstein matter.

politics,"There is an ongoing staffing crunch at the Social Security Administration. Here is one of the agency's field offices, on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption The Social Security Administration (SSA) recently reassigned a small share of its field office employees in an effort to bring down lengthy wait times for the agency's national 800 phone number. Workers at local offices across the country say these reassignments have been disruptive for staff and are increasing wait times for other services. Experts say the tradeoff is a byproduct of a declining Social Security workforce dealing with thousands more Americans who qualify for benefits every day. Thousands of employees have left the government agency in recent months. ""They are in a deep hole of their own creation on staffing and so you just don't have enough people to go around to serve the public,"" said Kathleen Romig, a former SSA official who's now director of Social Security and disability policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). ""And so all you can really do at this point is rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic."" Earlier this month, about 4% of front-line workers were temporarily reassigned to cover the national 800 number, according to the SSA, which added that phone service has improved as a result. ""Thanks to a new telephone platform, most callers are now served quickly through callbacks or automated options, and answer times have already improved significantly in field offices,"" the agency said in a statement to NPR. ""By temporarily assigning a small percentage of field office staff to assist with 800 number calls, we can improve the 800 [number] average speed of answer without disrupting local services."" But Nicole Morio, a field office worker in Staten Island and union representative, said these reassignments have forced front-line staff to take on more work. ""The stress level is probably at a maximum for everyone,"" Morio said. ""At one point I think we were doing the work of 1.8 people. Now it seems as though we're doing the work of 10 to 15."" Monique Buchanan, president of an American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) chapter that represents teleservice center workers, told NPR that the agency has also started to reassign vital claims specialists to the 800 number. Buchanan, who works at a field office in Detroit, said temporarily removing claims specialists from front-line positions is ""directly harmful to the public."" She said these workers finalize applications for people seeking help accessing benefits, such as payments for disabled children. ""These applications are taken through an interview that the claim specialist engages in,"" she said. ""So, the start is the interview with the claims specialist."" CBPP's Romig said staffing up the national hotline might not actually be faster for beneficiaries because so much work is done by claim specialists and other staff at field offices. ""Often customers can't actually complete their business on the phone,"" she said. ""They are going to have to end up in a field office ultimately anyway, or a field office employee is going to have to process that claim that has been taken on the phone or resolve the problem that has been raised on the phone."" The agency recently touted that it had reduced the average answering speed on the 800 number to ""13 minutes, a 35 percent reduction compared to this time last year and over a 50 percent reduction compared to last year's annual average."" But experts say it's harder to track whether the agency is doing better in other metrics. Recently the agency took down various real-time metrics from its website. Romig said it's possible wait times are decreasing as more people are transferred to 800-number duty, but it will surely come at the expense of other vital services. ""Sure, you can get a boost in a particular metric like phone hold times by making a massive shift of staffers to answer the phones,"" she said. ""But you do that by creating a new hole in the field offices, and that's what they're doing."" A Social Security Administration office on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption Morio, the Staten Island employee, believes she and other field office workers are being ""prevented"" from properly serving the people who need their help. ""We can't complete all of the things that need to be done,"" she said. ""When you have so little employees and so much work — it's stressful because we get hired to help the claimants. We get hired to help the American public. We're public servants. That's what we do."" Policy experts and front-line workers say that lowering wait times for phone services is a worthy goal, but it cannot be achieved without hiring more staff. Romig said staffing levels at Social Security were already at a decades-long low before the Trump administration began urging people to resign or retire early. According to agency officials, roughly 4,600 employees have left since March. Romig cautioned that staffing ""numbers are very hard to pin down"" because resignations are constantly ""in flux,"" due to the administration's deferred resignation program and ongoing early retirements. During a congressional hearing last month, new SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano told members he does not believe increasing staffing is necessary to improve the agency's services. ""I do agree we must perform significantly better,"" he said, ""but increased staffing is not the long-term solution."" But Jessica LaPointe, who works at a field office in Madison, Wis., and is the president of the local AFGE chapter that represents 25,000 field office workers, said the shuffling of staffing is prompting even more people to leave the agency. ""If they decided not to take the buyout incentives that were offered in March, then now they're just leaving to save their mental health as their work keeps piling up,"" LaPointe said. ""It really is a manufactured crisis as a result of past changes that just continue to just make everything worse, sadly."" Some local field offices only have a few employees, so the loss of one can have a big impact. Juan Daniel Vasquez, who is a generalist technical expert in a field office in Monroe, Mich., said his office had an employee who covered the phones who was recently shifted to the 800 number. He said that since then, all the staff have been tasked with covering the phones, which has added a significant amount of work to everyone's plate. ""It's a lot tougher,"" Vasquez said. ""I'm nearing retirement age and … if you had asked me last year, I would have said I want to stay another five to seven years. Now I'm looking at one to two."" The agency told NPR that Bisignano has been ""visiting field offices and processing centers to hear directly from front-line employees,"" since his confirmation hearing. ""He is committed to giving SSA employees the tools they need to provide best-in-class customer service to the American public and succeed in their roles,"" the agency said in a statement. ""SSA monitors all workload measures in the field offices that are helping answer the 800 Number calls. In addition, we have established field office support units to assist with critical workloads and demands."" But LaPointe said that working conditions for field office workers in the past few months have only gotten worse. ""There's no indication that this is getting better,"" she said. ""We have an agency not listening to the workers.""",Critical
politics,"The seal of the Department of Defense at the Pentagon. Mark Wilson/Getty Images hide caption The Department of Homeland Security is preparing to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants who entered the country illegally, as well as to increase the number of immigrants detained at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, according to correspondence between DHS and the Pentagon obtained by NPR. According to the letter, dated July 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the moves, which were requested by DHS the previous month. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, had sought immediate access to Camp Atterbury, a National Guard base in Indiana, and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, a base in New Jersey, from the Defense Department. ICE is also seeking to detain more immigrants without legal status at Guantánamo Bay prior to their final removal from the United States. ""DoD approves this support through September 30, 2025, subject to ICE maintaining a 24/7 oversight presence at each site to maintain custody and provide overall supervision of each site,"" stated the letter from Executive Secretary Anthony Fuscellaro to DHS acting Executive Secretary Andrew Whitaker. ICE staff and contractors will be responsible for all care and handling of the migrants, including meals, medical screening, transportation and medical services, according to the correspondence obtained by NPR. Neither DHS nor the Defense Department has yet responded to questions about the letter. On his first day in office, President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, enabling DHS to gain access to DOD's military resources. During congressional testimony, Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, told lawmakers he did not expect DHS to repay the Pentagon for their costs. The approval letter notes that DHS will pay DOD for any costs associated with migrant detention at McGuire Field, the Air Force base in New Jersey. The request for the use of additional military bases, and expansion at Guantánamo, comes as the Trump administration has pushed to arrest and detain more people in the country without legal status. DHS has nearly 57,000 people in immigration detention, though it only has about 41,000 beds . The department has sought out contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, local jurisdictions, and the use of military bases to detain migrants. By June, Guantánamo was holding about 500 migrants , though until now the base could only accommodate about 200 . In the letter to lawmakers obtained by NPR, Hegseth said that the use of the bases in Indiana and New Jersey for immigration detention ""will not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or other military requirements, including National Guard and Reserve readiness."" Camp Atterbury in Indiana will assist with removal operations out of the Chicago area; McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey will support Newark. Guantánamo Bay is designated to help with detentions and removals from Miami. The plan laid out by DHS calls for space for up to 1,000 people at the Indiana and New Jersey bases and to approximately double the capacity at Guantánamo to 400 people. DOD rejected a request from DHS for air transportation assistance until it got more details. In May, DHS asked for 20,000 National Guard members to assist ICE in its operations ranging from ""night raids"" and ""rural interdictions"" to guard duty at detention facilities. The Pentagon has already approved some 700 guard members to assist in Florida, Louisiana and Texas. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that hundreds more National Guard troops are expected to be called up to assist operations in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia. The Democratic congressional delegation in a statement condemned the terms of the use of the New Jersey base. ""This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources,"" they said in the statement. ""Using our country's military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful."" In addition to using the military, the Trump administration is expected to be able to scale up its detention capacity due to an influx of funding from Congress. The recent tax and spending bill set aside $45 billion for immigration detention centers and $30 billion for more ICE personnel, transportation costs and to maintain existing ICE facilities.",High

politics,"President Trump answering questions at the White House on July 11, 2025. Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption The Trump administration on Wednesday stepped up its attacks on ""woke"" artificial intelligence systems, a move propelled by the belief among some conservatives that AI models have drifted too far to the left. ""In order for all Americans to adopt and realize the benefits of AI, these systems must be built to reflect truth and objectivity, not top-down ideological bias,"" said Michael Kratsios, who leads the administration's office of science and technology policy, on a call with reporters on Wednesday. The Trump administration says more actions are expected on the ""woke"" AI issue, including an executive order later Wednesday. The White House is planning to revise Biden-era federal guidelines for AI safety to remove references to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change and misinformation, according to the Trump administration's AI action plan. And soon, the federal government will only do work with tech firms ""who ensure that their systems allow for free speech and expression to flourish,"" Kratsios said on the briefing call, echoing language from the administration's policy documents instructing tech companies to rid AI models of liberal bias. It is the latest instance of the Trump administration turning the screws on DEI initiatives and railing against popular AI chatbots. Trump supporters have increasingly criticized the technology, saying safety guardrails end up censoring conservative views. ""The AI industry is deeply concerned about this situation,"" said Neil Sahota, a technologist who advises the United Nations on artificial intelligence issues. ""They're already in a global arms race with AI, and now they're being asked to put some very nebulous measures in place to undo protections because they might be seen as woke,"" he said. ""It's freaking tech companies out."" One possible way AI companies could respond, according to Sahota, is to unveil ""anti-woke"" versions of their chatbots with fewer safeguards in order to land the lucrative business of the federal government. ""If you're a tech company with a lot of government contracts, this order is a sticky wicket,"" Sahota said. While some studies have shown that popular chatbots can at times deliver left-of-center responses to certain policy questions, experts say it can often come down to how a question is framed, or what part of the internet the system is summarizing. AI scholars say there is no proof that any major chatbot has been intentionally designed to generate liberal answers and censor conservative views. ""Often what is happening with these criticisms is that a chatbot doesn't align with someone's respective viewpoint, so they want to place the blame on the model,"" said Chinasa Okolo, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, DC. Turning ""woke AI"" into a rallying cry has parallels to a previous conservative battering ram against Silicon Valley: the belief that content guidelines on social media platforms were devised to muzzle right-wing perspectives. Last year, the howls over chatbots being ""woke"" intensified when Google's Gemini image generator depicted Black and Asian men as being U.S. founding fathers and Vikings as being ethnically diverse. Google executives apologized, and the company explained Gemini had overcorrected for diversity, including ""cases that should clearly not show a range."" Developing policies to counter such episodes has become a focus for White House AI czar David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, a senior policy advisor in the Trump administration. It is a striking reversal from how the Biden administration approached the technology, when officials sought ways to enact barriers against AI perpetuating bias and potentially violating peoples' civil rights. Now, new energy has been breathed into making AI a part of the larger culture wars. Conservative activists seized on the Google Gemini snafu, but when Elon Musk's Grok chatbot flew off the rails earlier this month and launched into antisemitic tirades, few right-wing commentators responded. Just days later, the maker of Grok, Musk's xAI, was awarded a Defense Department contract worth up to $200 million , along with Google, Anthropic and OpenAI. ""Musk's original vision for xAI was a sort of 'anti-woke AI,' but when you control poorly for data quality and disable safeguards, you get things like the recent Nazi episode,"" said Talia Ringer, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. xAI blamed outdated software code on the meltdown. In particular, instructions that told Grok to be ""maximally based,"" a slang term for holding strong opinions even if they are troubling, which was reinforced by a similar instruction given to the chatbot: ""You tell like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct."" The company said the issue has been fixed. Most popular chatbots have protections against things like slurs, harassment and hate speech, basic guardrails that may now be under new scrutiny by the Trump administration. ""Most of the examples I've seen conservatives cite of AI being too 'woke' are LLMs refusing to confirm conspiracy theories or racist claims,"" said Ringer, using the abbreviation for large language models, which underpin chatbot technology. To Okolo at the Brookings Institution, the battle over whether chatbots perpetuate left- or right-leaning views is overshadowed by another fight over the acceptance of provable facts. ""Some people, unfortunately, believe that basic facts with scientific basis are left-leaning, or 'woke,' and this does skew their perceptions a bit,"" she said. Doing the work of changing AI systems to respond to the White House executive order will be messy, said technologist Sahota, because where lines are drawn, and why, can initiate all sorts of political and cultural firestorms. ""What is even politically-driven? In this day and age, if someone says something about the importance of vaccination for measles, is that now a politically charged discussion?"" he said. ""But if there's potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in future federal contracts on the line, companies might have to do something, or they could be putting a serious amount of revenue in jeopardy.""",High
science,"Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. They impact almost every part of the body, including the heart, brain and even emotions. nicoletaionescu/Getty Images hide caption Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. They impact almost every part of the body, including the heart, brain and even emotions. Eating disorders among teenagers skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teens like Moorea Friedmann were isolated, spending more time in front of their computers watching movies and TV, where characters often seemed... perfect. ""You see the protagonist and they're all so beautiful,"" Friedmann says. ""And you're like, 'Do I have to look like that to be worthy? To be lovable?'"" Friedmann was already struggling with perfectionism and anxiety, and says she started to feel awful about herself. ""The world was spiraling out of control, and my body was spiraling out of control. And so what did I try to do? I tried to control it,"" she says. Eventually, Friedmann says she stopped getting her period, a condition called amenorrhea that signals the body's hormones aren't functioning properly. A doctor told her that her heart wasn't doing well, and Friedmann realized she was stuck in patterns that were hurting her mind and body. Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. Pediatrician Eva Trujillo says they ""literally rewire the brain,"" decrease brain size, and make it harder to concentrate and to regulate emotions. Malnutrition can slow the metabolism, impact bone density and even lead to cardiac arrest. Trujillo says that with the right treatment, people can also recover fully. ""But the brain needs time, food, therapy and compassion to heal,"" she says. Trujillo is the president of the International Association of Eating Disorder Professionals . She is also a co-founder of Comenzar de Nuevo , a leading treatment facility in Latin America, where patients of all ages and walks of life can get support and skill-build as they recover. For Friedmann, recovery also includes advocating for other teens struggling with eating disorders and other mental health conditions. She started a mental health and wellness podcast called Balancing Act . ""As I was digging myself out of this hole, I realized that I wanted to help other people who felt like they had been battling with this alone,"" she says.

science,"Newborn babies lie in bassinets in the nursery of a postpartum recovery center in upstate New York in 2017. A new study examined births over decades to find tendencies toward having all girls or all boys. Seth Wenig/AP hide caption Couples who've been surprised by a string of baby boys or baby girls could be forgiven for wondering whether the odds in the offspring lottery are more than just pure chance. A new study by Harvard University researchers that examines the birthing records of 58,007 women suggests their hunch might be correct. The authors of the study, published in the journal Science Advances last week , found that instead of straight 50/50 odds between boys and girls with each birth, the offspring in families with at least three children tend to follow what scientists call a ""weighted coin toss,"" indicating that each family may have a distinct tendency toward girls or boys. ""We're seeing a lot of us having only boys or girls,"" says Siwen Wang, a doctoral student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the lead author in the study. That led her and colleagues to wonder ""whether it's simply by chance, or is there any underlying biology explaining these sex clustering within families?"" They analyzed data from the second and third iteration of the Nurses' Health Study , which tracked just over 146,000 pregnancies across the U.S. from 1956 to 2015. They found that if the first two children born in a family are girls, the chances of the third child also being a girl are higher than for a boy — and this pattern continues with subsequent children. The same holds true if the first two are boys: The likelihood of having another boy increases, and the trend persists through later births. ""Notably, in families with three boys (MMM), the probability of having another boy was 61%; in families with three girls (FFF), the probability of having another girl was 58%,"" the study authors wrote. Looking for a possible explanation, ""one of the things that stands out is age at first birth — that's associated with a moderately higher chance of having only boys or girls,"" Wang says. ""If you're starting your family younger than 23 ... [there is] around a 40% chance of having a same-sex family,"" she says. If the woman begins having children after age 28, it's around 50% — a relatively small but statistically significant difference. The researchers excluded families with only one child and pregnancies ending in miscarriage, stillbirth or twins. Women with a history of infertility treatments were also left out of the study. To avoid bias from parents who stopped having children after reaching a preferred sex ratio, the researchers did not count each woman's final birth in the analysis. The researchers speculate that in older women, shorter menstrual cycles could factor into the results and that changes in vaginal acidity might favor the survival of sperm carrying either the Y (boys) or X (girls) chromosome. However, they note that because maternal and paternal ages are often correlated, the father's age might also play a role. Since the study included only women, the authors emphasize that the exact mechanism remains uncertain. ""We don't have data about the dad,"" Wang says. ""We don't have data about his genetics or even very precise characteristics ... which is obviously important for sex determination."" It's a concern also raised by Mark Gerstein, a professor at Yale University who wasn't involved in the research. Gerstein specializes in applying computational approaches to molecular biology. ""Given the disparity observed for mothers in the study, one could easily envision an equally impactful relationship with either the genetics or age of the father,"" he says. ""This seems like a promising area for future research to explore."" Ralph Catalano, an emeritus professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, who also wasn't involved in the research, thinks that the study's narrow focus on sex at birth may not show the full picture. ""Fewer than 50% of conceptions reach birth. More than 50% are spontaneously aborted [miscarried], and that's not a random draw,"" he says. Due to immunological and developmental sensitivity, females are more likely to be spontaneously aborted early in pregnancy, while males are more vulnerable to spontaneous abortion later in pregnancy because they are physically frailer, he says. ""The sex of infants we see — those who make it to birth — is shaped as much by in utero selection as by sex at conception,"" he says. Another caveat is the composition of the sample. The Nurses' Health Study that the sample was drawn from is made up of overwhelmingly white women residing in the United States. ""Since sex preferences and reproductive behaviors vary across cultures, religions, or countries … the sex ratio distribution pattern observed in our study may not apply to other societies,"" the researchers acknowledge.",High
science,"Tiny variations in the weather, tides and even the liquid inside the Earth's core can affect the length of the day. NASA hide caption If today feels like it's flying by, you can blame it on our spinning planet: A group of scientists tracking Earth's rotation predicts that the day will be a fraction of a second shorter than normal. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service , which measures the Earth's rotation and forecasts the length of the day, has predicted that July 22 could come out about a millisecond short of a standard 24-hour spin. Variations in the Earth's rotation are not uncommon: On July 9, for example, the Earth's quick spin shortened the day by nearly 1.4 milliseconds. But recent headlines from all over the world have been hyping ""freakishly short"" days in July and August. Scientific experts who constantly monitor the Earth's rotation seem a bit baffled and amused that a few slightly more-speedy-than-normal spins this summer have captured the public's imagination. ""We've known about the rotation of the Earth being variable for about a hundred years,"" says Dennis McCarthy, the former director of time at the U.S. Naval Observatory. ""This is just one of those little variations that comes along."" McCarthy, who's literally written the book on time and Earth's rotation, says the speed of the planet's spin gets influenced by all kinds of factors: the gravitational influence of the moon, the effect of winds and the atmosphere, plus the movements of the Earth's liquid core. Good data on the Earth's rotation goes back thousands of years, thanks to observations of solar eclipses in China. These days, researchers around the world track the spinning of the globe by pointing radio telescopes at quasars, incredibly luminous cores of distant galaxies that are so far away, they act as fixed points in space. That kind of data, plus information from GPS systems, all gets sent to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, which uses it to forecast the day length. Predictions are also made by others, such as the U.S. Naval Observatory. Generally speaking, over millions of years, the Earth's rotation has been slowing down, a trend that's expected to continue into the future, says McCarthy. The main reason is the moon. The moon's gravitational pull on the Earth creates ocean tides, and a process called ""tidal braking"" gradually slows the Earth's spin. ""We know it's slowing down, because we have a real good idea of the effect of the moon,"" says McCarthy. ""Although that slowing down is continuing, there are departures from that general pattern."" Specifically, over the last decade or so, there's been a bumper crop of days that are somewhat short. Last year's shortest day, July 5, 2024, was 1.65 milliseconds shorter than the usual 86,400 seconds, says Thomas Herring , a geophysicist with MIT. He says that was the shortest day since the 1950s, which is when researchers started comparing the rotation of the Earth to the very accurate time standard provided by atomic clocks that measure the regular oscillations of atoms. In the past, the world's timekeepers have occasionally resorted to adding in some ""leap seconds"" — these extra seconds keep atomic time in sync with Earth's rotation as it slows. The last time an extra second was added to the clock was in 2016. The recent speedy spins of the Earth, however, raise the possibility of instituting ""negative leap seconds,"" or basically taking away a second rather than adding one, which is something that's never been done before. ""I think it will be unlikely that a negative leap second will be invoked,"" says Herring, given that regular old leap seconds seem to be falling out of favor. While he and others say that the recent short-duration days are of little significance in and of themselves, understanding and being able to predict the precise rotation of the Earth is important for all kinds of applications—everything from launching missiles to navigation to high-tech farming. At the equator, in one second, the Earth will rotate the length of four football fields, says Nick Stamatakos, head of the Earth orientation department at the U.S. Naval Observatory. ""The Earth's moving pretty fast,"" he says. ""So any little variations will accumulate, and it's an issue."" By looking at the recent rotation history along with information about weather systems and long-term patterns, researchers can make predictions about how the Earth will spin on any given day. These predictions generally get less accurate the farther out they go. While the moon has long been the major player in controlling the speed of the Earth's rotation, one study found that humans are playing a role. Climate change is melting ice at the poles and sending water down to the equator, slowing the rotation down. The researchers believe that this effect is already lengthening the days. Some have calculated that in a worst-case scenario, climate change could eventually redistribute water in a way that would make the days milliseconds longer. That would make humans, rather than the moon, the dominant driver of changes to day length. ""We can really become the dominant drivers of Earth's rotation, due to human-induced climate change,"" says lead researcher Benedikt Soja of ETH Zürich, a university in Switzerland. ""That was really surprising, and really an interesting revelation to us.""",High

health,"Anopheles mosquito, Culicidae. De Agostini Editorial/via Getty Images hide caption Each year, 263 million people get malaria. But from the parasite's perspective, infecting humans is harder than you might think, and requires completing an epic journey within the tiny body of a mosquito. First, the mosquito must suck the blood of an individual infected with malaria — bringing the Plasmodium parasite into the insect's gut. Then the parasite must travel to the critter's salivary glands, where it's poised to be injected into the mosquito's next victim via a bite. Now a team of researchers have found a way to interrupt this crucial journey. By using gene editing to make a tiny tweak to the mosquito's genome — one that changes just a single amino acid — parasites were largely prevented from reaching their final destination. The change effectively rendered laboratory mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria , researchers report Wednesday in Nature. ""The idea that you could change just one amino acid and not have the parasite transmitted is a pretty big deal,"" says Fred Gould , an entomologist at North Carolina State University who wasn't involved in the study. ""It's really exciting."" That tiny tweak could be spread through a whole mosquito population using a gene drive, a genetic technology that breaks the normal 50-50 rules of inheritance. Gene drives are sequences of DNA that can be inserted into the genome of an individual and cause a specific mutation or gene to be passed on to virtually all offspring, instead of just 50%. Eventually, researchers hope to engineer mosquitoes with this approach and release them into the wild. ""These mosquitoes will spread on their own and gradually transform the malaria-transmitting mosquito population to one that cannot transmit malaria,"" says George Dimopoulos , a biologist at Johns Hopkins University and study co-author. Dimopoulos isn't claiming this technique will be the final nail in malaria's coffin, and it's far from being ready for release. It'll likely be several years, at least, before field tests, and will require buy-in and approval by local communities and governments. But he argues new genetic tools are needed to quash the disease, since existing ones like bed nets and antimalarial drugs haven't been able to turn malaria — which kills 600,000 a year — into a disease of the past. But gene drive technology is controversial. ""Gene drives could have far-reaching, unpredictable negative consequences,"" says Dana Perls , senior program manager on emerging technologies at Friends of the Earth, an environmental non-profit. Because they distort normal patterns of inheritance, ""the genetic changes from a gene drive to a population of mosquitoes are very likely to persist for a long time, possibly permanently."" Critics worry that gene drives designed to spread one tiny change to the genome could end up mutating to affect other parts of the genome. That could result in unanticipated changes spreading fast through a population before researchers would have a chance to stop it, potentially upending the delicate balance of an ecosystem. Still, researchers are exploring several gene editing strategies. Some aim to suppress mosquito populations by rendering individuals infertile. But there are worries that wiping out mosquitoes could have unintended consequences for ecosystems — for example by removing a food source for birds and bats. Another strategy is to engineer mosquitoes with new genes that would make proteins that mess with the parasite itself, curbing transmission without harming the bugs. Dimopoulos and his colleagues wanted to take a different approach, one that messed with the parasite, but without adding an entirely new gene. They settled on a gene called FREP1 . It helps mosquitoes feed on blood. But it also appears to be important to the parasites, which use it to complete their crucial journey to the salivary glands in ways researchers don't fully understand. Some mosquitoes have a small genetic change that seems to disrupt this journey. The researchers used CRISPR, a gene editing technology that can very precisely change the genome, to create two nearly-identical Anopheles stephensi groups, one with the normal FREP1 gene and one with the variant. The variant is very small, changing just one amino acid, the basic building blocks of proteins. But that small change had big effects. Mosquitoes with the edited variant have about 5 times fewer infective parasites in the salivary glands, a median of zero compared with thousands in non-edited mosquitoes. There were significantly fewer parasites in the gut, too. Otherwise, the insects appeared perfectly healthy. It's unclear exactly how much this genetic tweak would impair a mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. But previous research suggests ""something on the order of a 90% reduction in malaria transmission would be more or less what you'd expect,"" says Ethan Bier , a geneticist at the University of California San Diego and study co-author. ""I was surprised myself that a single amino acid change could do that."" Next, the researchers showed that they could rapidly spread this beneficial change with a gene drive. It took just 10 generations for the variant to spread to over 90% of their laboratory population. ""It's really excellent work,"" says Anthony James , a molecular biologist at the University of California Irvine who wasn't involved in the study, but works on introducing new resistance genes to mosquitoes. Since the change is naturally occurring, he says it could be ""marginally more acceptable"" to people wary of genetic engineering. ""It's good to have more than one approach available,"" he says. That's especially important if the malaria parasite evolves resistance against these new tools.",Critical
health,"Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. They impact almost every part of the body, including the heart, brain and even emotions. nicoletaionescu/Getty Images hide caption Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. They impact almost every part of the body, including the heart, brain and even emotions. Eating disorders among teenagers skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teens like Moorea Friedmann were isolated, spending more time in front of their computers watching movies and TV, where characters often seemed... perfect. ""You see the protagonist and they're all so beautiful,"" Friedmann says. ""And you're like, 'Do I have to look like that to be worthy? To be lovable?'"" Friedmann was already struggling with perfectionism and anxiety, and says she started to feel awful about herself. ""The world was spiraling out of control, and my body was spiraling out of control. And so what did I try to do? I tried to control it,"" she says. Eventually, Friedmann says she stopped getting her period, a condition called amenorrhea that signals the body's hormones aren't functioning properly. A doctor told her that her heart wasn't doing well, and Friedmann realized she was stuck in patterns that were hurting her mind and body. Eating disorders are complicated illnesses. Pediatrician Eva Trujillo says they ""literally rewire the brain,"" decrease brain size, and make it harder to concentrate and to regulate emotions. Malnutrition can slow the metabolism, impact bone density and even lead to cardiac arrest. Trujillo says that with the right treatment, people can also recover fully. ""But the brain needs time, food, therapy and compassion to heal,"" she says. Trujillo is the president of the International Association of Eating Disorder Professionals . She is also a co-founder of Comenzar de Nuevo , a leading treatment facility in Latin America, where patients of all ages and walks of life can get support and skill-build as they recover. For Friedmann, recovery also includes advocating for other teens struggling with eating disorders and other mental health conditions. She started a mental health and wellness podcast called Balancing Act . ""As I was digging myself out of this hole, I realized that I wanted to help other people who felt like they had been battling with this alone,"" she says.

health,"Sonya Sotinsky sits at Crane Cove Park in San Francisco on March 25. Sotinsky was diagnosed with Stage 4 tongue cancer and underwent surgery to remove her tongue, larynx and other structures. She then worked with researchers to create an AI-generated voice using past recordings of her speech. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption When doctors told her they had to remove her tongue and voice box to save her life from the cancer that had invaded her mouth, Sonya Sotinsky sat down with a microphone to record herself saying the things she would never again be able to say. This story was produced in partnership with KFF Health News . ""Happy birthday"" and ""I'm proud of you"" topped the phrases she banked for her husband and two daughters, as well as ""I'll be right with you,"" intended for customers at the architecture firm she co-owns in Tucson, Arizona. Thinking about the grandchildren she desperately hoped to see born one day, she also recorded herself reading more than a dozen children's books, from Eloise to Dr. Seuss, to one day play for them at bedtime. But one of the biggest categories of sound files she banked was a string of curse words and filthy sayings. If the voice is the primary expression of personality, sarcasm and profanity are essential to Sotinsky's. ""When you can't use your voice, it is very, very frustrating. Other people project what they think your personality is. I have silently screamed and screamed at there being no scream,"" said Sotinsky in a recent interview, referring to rudimentary voice technology or writing notes by hand. ""What the literal you-know-what?"" Fighting invasive oral cancer at age 51 forced Sotinsky to confront the existential importance of the human voice. Her unique intonation, cadence and slight New Jersey accent, she felt, were fingerprints of her identity. And she refused to be silenced. Sonya Sotinsky uses an app on her phone to talk with her daughter Ela Fuentevilla at Crane Cove Park in San Francisco on March 25. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption While her doctors and insurance company saved her life, they showed little interest in saving her voice, she said. So she set out on her own to research and identify the artificial intelligence company that could. It used the recordings Sotinsky banked of her natural voice to build an exact replica now stored in an app on her phone, allowing her to type and speak once again with a full range of sentiment and sarcasm. ""She got her sass back,"" said Sotinsky's daughter, Ela Fuentevilla, 23. ""When we heard her AI voice, we all cried, my sister, my dad and I. It's crazy similar."" It took close to a year for doctors to catch Sotinsky's cancer. She complained to her orthodontist and dentist multiple times about jaw pain and a strange sensation under her tongue. Then water began dribbling down her chin when she drank. When the pain got so intense she could no longer speak at the end of each day, Sotinsky insisted her orthodontist take a closer look. ""A shadow cast over his face. I saw it when he leaned back,"" she said, ""that look you don't want to see."" That's when she started recording. In the five weeks between her diagnosis and surgery to remove her entire tongue and voice box – in medical terms, a total glossectomy and laryngectomy – she banked as much of her voice as she could manage. ""Your voice is your identity,"" said Dr. Sue Yom , a radiation oncologist at UC-San Francisco, where Sotinsky got treatment. ""Communication is not only how we express ourselves and relate to other people, but also how we make sense of the world."" ""When the voice is no longer available, you can't hear yourself thinking out loud, you can't hear yourself interacting with other people,"" Yom said. ""It impacts how your mind works."" People who lose their voice box, she added, are at higher risk for long-term emotional distress , depression and physical pain compared with those who retain it after cancer treatment. Close to a third lose their job , and the social isolation can be profound. Most laryngectomy patients learn to speak again with an electrolarynx , a small battery-operated box held against the throat that produces a monotonic, mechanical voice. But without a tongue to shape her words, Sotinsky knew that wouldn't work for her. Dr. Sue Yom, a radiation oncologist, stands with a radiotherapy system used to deliver precise, high-dose radiation treatments for cancer patients at the University of California San Francisco's Mission Bay medical center on May 16. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption When Sotinsky had her surgery in January 2022, AI voices were still in their infancy. The best technology she could find yielded a synthetic version of her voice, but it was still flat and robotic, and others strained to understand her. She got by until mid-2024, when she read about tech companies using generative AI to replicate a person's full range of natural inflection and emotion. While companies can now recreate a person's voice from snippets of old home movies or even a one-minute voicemail, 30 minutes is the sweet spot. Sotinsky had banked hours in her children's book readings. ""Eloise saved my voice,"" Sotinsky said. Now she types what she wants to say into a text-to-speech app on her phone, called Whisper , which translates and broadcasts her AI voice through portable speakers. Sonya Sotinsky often uses a portable keyboard to talk using the text-to-speech software on her phone. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption Most doctors and speech therapists who work with head and neck cancer patients don't realize AI software can be used this way, Yom said, and with their focus on saving lives they often don't have the bandwidth to encourage patients to record their voices before they lose them in surgery. Health insurance companies likewise prioritize treatments that extend life over those that improve its quality — and typically avoid covering new technologies until data proves their actuarial value. Sotinsky and her daughter spent months wrangling with claims adjusters at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona , but the insurer refused to reimburse Sotinsky for the $3,000 she spent on her initial assistive speaking technology. ""Apparently, having a voice is not considered a medical necessity,"" Sotinsky quipped, her AI voice edged with sarcasm. Sotinsky now pays the $99 monthly fee for her AI voice clone out of pocket. ""While health plans cover both routine and life-saving care, assistive communication devices are typically not covered,"" said Teresa Joseph , a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. ""As AI provides opportunities to impact health, we imagine that coverage criteria will evolve nationally."" Sotinsky resolved to use her newfound voice to help others regain theirs. She stepped back from her work in architecture and built two websites detailing her voice banking journey — voicebanknow.com and glossectomygirl.com . She tells her story at conferences and webinars, including an oncology conference in Denver that Yom organized for 80 scientists. One doctor who attended, Jennifer De Los Santos , was so inspired by hearing Sotinsky's voice that she began laying the groundwork for a clinical trial on the impact AI technology has on patients' communication and quality of life. That type of research could generate the data health insurers need to measure actuarial value. ""And therefore justify coverage by insurance,"" said De Los Santos, a head and neck cancer researcher and professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Breast cancer survivors faced a similar battle in the 1980s and '90s, she added. Insurers initially refused to cover the cost of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, calling the procedure cosmetic and unnecessary. It took years of patient advocacy and carefully crafted data showing reconstruction had a profound impact on women's physical and emotional well-being before the federal government mandated insurance coverage in 1998. Both De Los Santos and Yom said research data on AI voice clones will likely follow a similar path, eventually proving that a fully functioning, natural-sounding voice can lead to not only a better life, but a longer one. Sonya Sotinsky has built two websites detailing her experience in voice banking and tells her story at conferences, including an oncology conference in Denver for 80 scientists. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption In recent months, Sotinsky's AI voice literally helped save her life. Her cancer had resurged in her lungs and liver. Her voice allowed her to communicate with her doctors and participate fully in developing the treatment plan. It showed her just how ""medically necessary"" having a voice is. She noticed that doctors and nurses took her more seriously. They didn't tune out the way people often did when she relied on her more robotic, synthesized voice. It seemed they saw her as more fully human. ""If someone can only communicate using a few words at a time, and not elaborate and interface more fully, it's natural that you can't detect that they have more depth of thought,"" she said. ""Being able to dialogue with my care team in a more seamless way is vital."" While doctors successfully treated her latest round of cancer, Sotinsky, now 55, said she is confronting her odds in a new way, facing the reality that she will likely die much sooner than she wants. All over again, she realized how crucial her voice is for maintaining perspective on life and a sense of humor in the face of death. ""I tend to forget and think I am fine, when in reality, this is forever now. Emotionally, you start to get cocky again and this was like, 'Whoa, b****, we ain't playing.' This cancer is real,"" Sotinsky said, typing her next phrase with a mischievous grin. ""Sarcasm is part of my love language.""

health,"In Montana, one man says Medicaid and the drug coverage he gets through it are what allow him to work. But a raise he has gotten could mean he loses Medicaid, so he says he decided to ""fudge the numbers."" Oona Zenda/KFF Health News hide caption MISSOULA, Mont. — As congressional Republicans finalized Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, one man who relies on that government-subsidized health coverage was trying to coax his old car to start after an eight-hour shift making sandwiches. James asked that only his middle name be used to tell his story so that he wouldn't lose health coverage or be accused of Medicaid fraud. He found his food service gig a few weeks into an addiction treatment program. The man, who is in his late 30s, said his boss ""hasn't been disappointed."" ""I'm a good worker,"" he said with a grin. James can get the prescription drugs that help him stabilize his life and hold down that job through Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program that covers people with low incomes or disabilities. Those drugs curb his desire for alcohol and treat long-standing conditions that exacerbate his addiction, including bipolar and insomnia disorders. But he hasn't qualified for the program in months, ever since his work hours increased and he received a raise of about $1 an hour. He exceeds his income eligibility limit of about $21,000 per year by roughly $50 a week. James said that despite his raise, he's struggling to cover routine expenses, such as keeping his car running and paying his phone bill. He said he can't afford the care he needs even on the cheapest insurance plan available to him through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace or through his job's health insurance plan. Even paying $60 a month for his sleep medications — one of six prescriptions he takes daily — is too expensive. ""I only saw one option,"" James said. ""Fudge the numbers."" James hasn't reported his new income to the state. That puts him at odds with congressional Republicans who justified adding hurdles to Medicaid by claiming the system is rife with waste, fraud and abuse. But James isn't someone sitting on his couch playing video games, the type of person House Speaker Mike Johnson and others said they would target as they sought to impose work requirements. Medicaid provides health coverage and long-term care to more than 70 million people in the United States. Those who study safety-net systems say it's extremely rare for enrollees to commit fraud to tap into that coverage. In fact, research shows that swaths of eligible people aren't enrolled in Medicaid, likely because the system is so confusing. And nearly two-thirds of people on Medicaid in 2023 had jobs, according to an analysis by KFF , a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Those transitioning off Medicaid may qualify for other subsidized or low-priced health plans through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace. But, as in James' case, such plans can have gaps in what care is covered, and more comprehensive private plans may be too expensive. So James and an unknown number of other people find themselves caught between working too much to qualify for Medicaid but earning too little to pay for their own health care. James considers himself to be a patriot and said that people shouldn't ""use government funding to just be lazy."" He agrees with the Republican argument that, if able, people should work if they receive Medicaid. “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” James Hiding his hours on the job from the government bothers him, especially since he feels he must lie to access the medical care that enables him to work. ""I don't want to be a fraud. I don't want to die,"" James said. ""Those shouldn't be the only two options."" On July 4, Trump signed into law the major tax and spending bill that makes it harder for low-income workers to get Medicaid. That includes requiring beneficiaries to work or go to school and adding paperwork to prove they meet a minimum number of hours on the job every six months. ""It's going to hurt people, whether they're playing by the rules or not,"" said Ben Sommers , a health economist at Harvard University. ""We see this vilification of mostly very hardworking people who are really struggling and are benefiting from a program that helps them stay alive."" James said he initially declined his raise because he worried about losing Medicaid. He had previously been kicked off the coverage about a month into his rehab program after finding work. To stay in the sober-living program he otherwise couldn't afford, James said, he dropped just enough hours at work to requalify for Medicaid and then soon picked up hours again. If he didn't earn more, he said, he had no chance of saving enough money to find housing after graduating from the treatment program. ""They'll give you a bone if you stay in the mud,"" James said. ""But you have to stay there."" That problem — becoming just successful enough to suddenly lose Medicaid — is common. It's called a benefit cliff, said Pamela Herd , who researches government aid at the University of Michigan. ""It just doesn't make any sense that someone gets a dollar pay raise and all of a sudden they lose all access to their health insurance,"" Herd said. She said a partial fix exists called continuous eligibility, which guarantees an individual's Medicaid coverage for a specific period, such as a year or longer. The goal is to give people time to adjust when they do earn more money. Continuous eligibility also helps maintain coverage for low-income workers with unpredictable hours and whose pay changes month to month. But Congress has moved in the other direction. Under the new law, policymakers limited windows of eligibility for able-bodied adults to every six months. That will put more people on the program's eligibility cliff, Herd said, in which they must decide between losing access to coverage or dropping hours at work. ""It is going to be a nightmare,"" Herd said. Those federal changes will be especially difficult for people with chronic conditions, such as James in Montana. Not that long ago, James wouldn't have been breaking the rules to access Medicaid because his state had 12-month continuous eligibility. But in 2023, Montana began requiring enrollees to report any change in their income within 10 days. James is proud of how far he has come. About a year ago, his body was breaking down. He couldn't hold a spoon to eat breakfast without whiskey — his hands shook too hard. He had alcohol-induced seizures. He said his memories from his unhealthiest times come in flashes: being put on a stretcher, the face of a worried landlord, ambulance lights in the background. James recently graduated from his treatment program. He's staying with a relative to save money as he and his girlfriend try to find an affordable place to rent — though even with Medicaid, finding housing feels like a stretch to him. He's taking classes part time to become a licensed addiction counselor. His dream is to help others survive addiction, and he also sees that career as a way out of poverty. To James, all his progress rides on keeping Medicaid a bit longer. ""Every time I get a piece of mail, I am terrified that I'm gonna open it up and it's gonna say I don't have Medicaid anymore,"" he said. ""I'm constantly in fear that it's gonna go away."" As of mid-July, officials hadn't noticed the extra $50 he makes each week.

health,"Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, D-N.M., speaks in favor of reauthorizing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 2024. The legislation, which will benefit people sickened by radiation exposure in uranium mining and nuclear weapons testing, was included in the budget bill President Trump signed on July 4, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images hide caption Children who lived near a St. Louis creek polluted with radioactive atomic bomb waste from the 1940s through the 1960s were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer over their lifetimes than children who lived farther from the waterway, a new study has found. The findings, published in JAMA Network Open, corroborate worries that neighbors of Coldwater Creek have long held about the Missouri River tributary where generations of children played. ""We actually saw something quite dramatic, not only elevated risk of cancer, but one that increased steadily in a sort of dose-response manner the closer the childhood residents got to Coldwater Creek,"" said the study's senior author, Marc Weisskopf, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As part of the Manhattan Project, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works processed uranium in St. Louis for the development of an atomic bomb. By the mid-1940s, according to historians, the company began to haul its radioactive waste north of the city, leaving it in open steel drums, unattended and exposed to the elements, next to Coldwater Creek. The study's release comes shortly after passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" which contained a little-known provision to help people sickened by exposure to nuclear waste in Missouri and elsewhere. It provides payments of $25,000 to families of people who died as a result of radiation-linked cancers in the St. Louis area and $50,000 to those who developed the cancers and survived. Like the new study, the provision recognizes the potential health risks from lower radiation levels associated with the production of the atomic bomb. Previous legislation, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act , known as RECA, expired last year after paying out $2.6 billion to people who developed cancer after exposure to high-dose radiation from participating in onsite atomic weapon testing, mining or hauling uranium or being downwind of the Nevada test site. U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, made sure the RECA reauthorization was included in the recently passed budget bill and that it included benefits for his constituents who lived near the contaminated creek. Al Drago/Getty Images hide caption Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, pushed to get a new version of RECA into the Trump budget bill. Hawley had been a vocal critic of the BBB's $900 billion cut to Medicaid, but in the end voted for the massive package of tax and spending cuts. Hawley's yes vote came after a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals was added to the BBB. Weisskopf and his research team had the addresses of 4,209 tooth donors from the St. Louis Baby Tooth Survey. Participants, born between 1945 and 1966, donated their baby teeth for science starting in 1958 and joined the new experiment between 2021 and 2024. Weisskopf initially planned to study cognitive decline, but after participants repeatedly mentioned Coldwater Creek, he pivoted to investigating proximity to the creek and cancer risk. Almost one-quarter of the participants reported having cancer. Those who lived within one kilometer of the creek as children were 44% more likely to report having cancer than those who lived more than 20 kilometers away. Even more striking, those who lived within one kilometer of the creek were 85% more likely to have radiosensitive cancers, cancers believed to be caused by radiation. Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist and epidemiology professor at the University of California, said she was impressed with the design of the study, with which she was not involved. ""This study adds to our understanding that radiation is carcinogenic and that we have to be cautious to minimize exposures to radiation wherever possible,"" she said. The main source of exposure today comes from medical imaging, she said. The study also highlights the need to clean up areas, like shipyards, with radioactive waste, she said. Male study participants were more likely than female participants to develop cancer, Smith-Bindman noted. She and Weisskopf hypothesized that the boys were more likely to play in Coldwater Creek in the aftermath of World War II. In 1958, scientists at Washington University began collecting the baby teeth of children from St. Louis. The teeth were used in studies investigating possible links between cancer and the fallout from nuclear tests in the western U.S. St. Louis was chosen not because of its connection to uranium production but because milk in the Midwest had some of the nation's highest levels of strontium-90, a radioactive isotope produced by nuclear fission. High concentrations of strontium-90 found in donated baby teeth contributed to the adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. A 2011 study found that men who were children in St. Louis in the 1960s and died of cancer by middle age had more than twice as much radioactive strontium in their baby teeth as men who grew up nearby and were still alive. Though he did not use the baby teeth in his current study, Weisskopf would like to measure strontium-90 in the teeth in a future study to assess cancer risk and actual exposure. ""As boys, they might have played in the creek way more than girls, and so they got much more exposure,"" he said. ""If that were the case, then the radiation in the teeth should be higher in the boys than in the girls."" Given that the half-life of strontium-90 is 29 years, Weisskopf is eager to begin work on a more detailed study while radiation remains in the baby teeth.",Medium
business,"President Trump answering questions at the White House on July 11, 2025. Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption The Trump administration on Wednesday stepped up its attacks on ""woke"" artificial intelligence systems, a move propelled by the belief among some conservatives that AI models have drifted too far to the left. ""In order for all Americans to adopt and realize the benefits of AI, these systems must be built to reflect truth and objectivity, not top-down ideological bias,"" said Michael Kratsios, who leads the administration's office of science and technology policy, on a call with reporters on Wednesday. The Trump administration says more actions are expected on the ""woke"" AI issue, including an executive order later Wednesday. The White House is planning to revise Biden-era federal guidelines for AI safety to remove references to diversity, equity and inclusion, climate change and misinformation, according to the Trump administration's AI action plan. And soon, the federal government will only do work with tech firms ""who ensure that their systems allow for free speech and expression to flourish,"" Kratsios said on the briefing call, echoing language from the administration's policy documents instructing tech companies to rid AI models of liberal bias. It is the latest instance of the Trump administration turning the screws on DEI initiatives and railing against popular AI chatbots. Trump supporters have increasingly criticized the technology, saying safety guardrails end up censoring conservative views. ""The AI industry is deeply concerned about this situation,"" said Neil Sahota, a technologist who advises the United Nations on artificial intelligence issues. ""They're already in a global arms race with AI, and now they're being asked to put some very nebulous measures in place to undo protections because they might be seen as woke,"" he said. ""It's freaking tech companies out."" One possible way AI companies could respond, according to Sahota, is to unveil ""anti-woke"" versions of their chatbots with fewer safeguards in order to land the lucrative business of the federal government. ""If you're a tech company with a lot of government contracts, this order is a sticky wicket,"" Sahota said. While some studies have shown that popular chatbots can at times deliver left-of-center responses to certain policy questions, experts say it can often come down to how a question is framed, or what part of the internet the system is summarizing. AI scholars say there is no proof that any major chatbot has been intentionally designed to generate liberal answers and censor conservative views. ""Often what is happening with these criticisms is that a chatbot doesn't align with someone's respective viewpoint, so they want to place the blame on the model,"" said Chinasa Okolo, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, DC. Turning ""woke AI"" into a rallying cry has parallels to a previous conservative battering ram against Silicon Valley: the belief that content guidelines on social media platforms were devised to muzzle right-wing perspectives. Last year, the howls over chatbots being ""woke"" intensified when Google's Gemini image generator depicted Black and Asian men as being U.S. founding fathers and Vikings as being ethnically diverse. Google executives apologized, and the company explained Gemini had overcorrected for diversity, including ""cases that should clearly not show a range."" Developing policies to counter such episodes has become a focus for White House AI czar David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, a senior policy advisor in the Trump administration. It is a striking reversal from how the Biden administration approached the technology, when officials sought ways to enact barriers against AI perpetuating bias and potentially violating peoples' civil rights. Now, new energy has been breathed into making AI a part of the larger culture wars. Conservative activists seized on the Google Gemini snafu, but when Elon Musk's Grok chatbot flew off the rails earlier this month and launched into antisemitic tirades, few right-wing commentators responded. Just days later, the maker of Grok, Musk's xAI, was awarded a Defense Department contract worth up to $200 million , along with Google, Anthropic and OpenAI. ""Musk's original vision for xAI was a sort of 'anti-woke AI,' but when you control poorly for data quality and disable safeguards, you get things like the recent Nazi episode,"" said Talia Ringer, a computer science professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. xAI blamed outdated software code on the meltdown. In particular, instructions that told Grok to be ""maximally based,"" a slang term for holding strong opinions even if they are troubling, which was reinforced by a similar instruction given to the chatbot: ""You tell like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct."" The company said the issue has been fixed. Most popular chatbots have protections against things like slurs, harassment and hate speech, basic guardrails that may now be under new scrutiny by the Trump administration. ""Most of the examples I've seen conservatives cite of AI being too 'woke' are LLMs refusing to confirm conspiracy theories or racist claims,"" said Ringer, using the abbreviation for large language models, which underpin chatbot technology. To Okolo at the Brookings Institution, the battle over whether chatbots perpetuate left- or right-leaning views is overshadowed by another fight over the acceptance of provable facts. ""Some people, unfortunately, believe that basic facts with scientific basis are left-leaning, or 'woke,' and this does skew their perceptions a bit,"" she said. Doing the work of changing AI systems to respond to the White House executive order will be messy, said technologist Sahota, because where lines are drawn, and why, can initiate all sorts of political and cultural firestorms. ""What is even politically-driven? In this day and age, if someone says something about the importance of vaccination for measles, is that now a politically charged discussion?"" he said. ""But if there's potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in future federal contracts on the line, companies might have to do something, or they could be putting a serious amount of revenue in jeopardy.""",High
business,"A 2023 Model X sports-utility vehicle sits outside a Tesla dealership Sunday, June 18, 2023, in Englewood, Colo. David Zalubowski/AP hide caption Tesla on Wednesday reported a drop in its profit during the second quarter, as the electric vehicle maker continues to struggle despite CEO Elon Musk's pivot back to focusing on his companies after his controversial role leading the Trump administration's government cost cutting efforts. The company's electric vehicle sales have been flagging, and earlier this month it reported a drop of 13.5% in the quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. On Wednesday, Tesla said its net income also suffered, slumping 16% year-on-year. That paled in comparison to the 71% drop in year-on-year profits the company reported during the first quarter, when sales were down 13%. Tesla will hold a call with investors tonight to discuss the report, which highlighted Tesla's other ventures, calling this quarter ""a seminal point in Tesla's history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services."" The company rolled out the first iteration of its robotaxi service in Austin in June, and the earnings report said the company's approach to the service would allow for rapid scaling and improved profitability. The company is also developing a humanoid robot called Optimus . During the second quarter, Tesla's total automotive revenue slipped 16% while energy generation and storage revenue was off 7%. Services and other revenue grew by 17%. Onlookers have blamed Tesla's flagging car sales on Musk's political activity , although during the previous quarter's call he said he didn't see ""any reduction in demand"" and, without evidence, dismissed protests against his company as ""paid for."" Surveys have found that the company's brand reputation has taken a serious hit , particularly among liberal or Democratic car shoppers — who tend to be more likely, at least right now, to shop for an electric vehicle. Musk has stepped away from his leadership of DOGE and had a very public split with Donald Trump , but he remains interested in politics, recently floating the idea of launching a third party. Another likely factor is increased competition among EV makers. In the U.S., the traditional automakers — who have lagged far behind Tesla on electric vehicles — are gradually eating into Tesla's market dominance. According to the latest data from Cox, Tesla accounts for 46.2% of EV sales in the U.S.; that figure used to be nearly 80%. GM now controls 13% of that market. Globally, meanwhile, Chinese EV makers are ascendent . Tesla, which has long been known for a high rate of executive turnover, lost three senior leaders in the last two months. The company also worried investors earlier this month when it failed to announce its annual shareholder meeting. Tesla is incorporated in Texas, where state law requires the company to hold the meeting within 13 months of the previous one. That meant a deadline of July 13. On July 9, with no word from Tesla about the meeting, a group of large shareholders sent Tesla's board a letter raising concerns about the oversight. One day later, the company announced it was pushing its annual meeting back to November . Tesla's share price ticked down slightly in after-hours trading following the news.",High

business,"This is a satellite image collected on Nov. 13, 2012, of the Maoniuping Mine, one of China's largest rare earth elements mines, located near Mianning, Sichuan province, China. DigitalGlobe/Maxar via Getty Images hide caption Deep in an underground, World War II-era vault on the outskirts of Frankfurt, Germany, investment manager Louis O'Connor guards his firm's most valuable assets. The treasure inside? Rare earth elements. ""Make no mistake about it, there's 3 1/2-meter walls and doors and armed security,"" says O'Connor, the CEO of Strategic Metals Invest, a firm that lets individual investors buy into stockpiles of rare earths. Many so-called rare earth elements are actually quite common, and they are mined globally, but China has a near-monopoly on refining them for use in everyday electronics, like smartphones and speakers, as well as for crucial defense systems, like fighter jets. When China decided to tighten control over supply chains for seven rare earth elements this spring, O'Connor says he felt the pinch immediately. One investor touring the company's vault at the time offered on the spot to buy O'Connor's entire inventory of terbium and dysprosium, two valuable ""heavy"" rare earth elements, he says. The episode illustrated the power of China's dominance over the industry. ""They're installing what you might call a tap system, where they can turn that tap on and off,"" says O'Connor, remarking on China's recent policy. That supply chain chokehold has given China a powerful tool it has wielded in a trade war with the United States. Within weeks of China requiring foreign companies to apply for a license to buy rare earths in early April, several U.S. and European corporations said they were forced to shut down production lines. Regaining access to Chinese rare earths was a central point of contention in U.S.-China trade negotiations this spring. But China did not always enjoy such dominance. Developing an export control regime they could minutely control took decades of sometimes painful trial and error. The Mountain Pass rare earth mine and processing facility, owned by MP Materials, is viewed from an airplane flying at 37,000 feet on Sept. 1, 2023, in Mountain Pass, Calif. George Rose/Getty Images hide caption For much of the second half of the 20th century, the United States controlled the market on rare earth elements, after prospectors discovered them in Mountain Pass , Calif., in 1949 . China recognized the strategic value of rare earths, and starting in the 1960s, Chinese executives visited Mountain Pass several times, says Mark Smith, who was the CEO at Molycorp, a former rare earths processing company at the Mountain Pass mine. ""We toured them. We explained what we do, allowed them to take pictures and everything else. They took it back to China,"" Smith says, who gave tours of Molycorp to Chinese visitors in the 1980s and 1990s. Chinese refineries then improved on technology, and taking advantage of cheap electricity in China, hundreds of lucrative mining and processing firms in the country popped up to service mostly domestic demand for rare earths. Loading... But the industry was highly unregulated and chaotic, as hundreds of small-scale, private mines and refineries competed against one another, undercutting each other's profits. ""They drive down the price against themselves,"" says Chris Ruffle, an investor who has worked in China for decades, including in the metals industry. ""They kill themselves."" China's then-industry minister, Xiao Yaqing, attends a news conference of the State Council Information Office on March 1, 2021, in Beijing. Visual China Group/Getty Images hide caption ""China's rare earths aren't being sold at a 'rare' price but at an 'earth' price,"" Xiao Yaqing, a former minister of industry, complained in 2021. As Chinese producers sought an upper hand in rare earths, they also unleashed unrestrained mining that came at great cost to the environment. In the early 2000s, Ruffle visited a private rare earths refinery in Jiangsu, a province in southern China. ""The thick smoke slightly gave it away,"" Ruffle says of the facilities. He describes huge piles of tailings — toxic, metallic by-products from other industrial processes — sitting on the bare ground. Destructive, small-scale mining was especially prevalent in southern China, where the most valuable, natural deposits of ""heavy"" rare earth elements are. ""They would mine the side of the hill with their axes and picks and shovels, and then they would dig a hole in the ground, no liners or anything like that at all. Then they poured five gallon buckets of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid … and let that certain stew for a while,"" remembers Smith, who frequently visited China during this period. ""When the storms come in, all that acid just washes out."" The mining left China's terrain scarred with lasting groundwater and soil pollution. Local residents staged periodic protests against rare earth mining, but the industry provided local governments with abundant revenue , and they repeatedly ignored central government orders to close down dirty mines. A Chinese media investigation into the industry in 2012 compared the rare earths industry in China during this time to trafficking illegal drugs. ""There are generally two types of people who can deal with rare earths: the first is someone who has just been released from prison, and the other is someone who can get someone out of prison. Those who are not afraid of death and leading cadres are all involved,"" the state media article said. Multiple Chinese businesses and individuals declined requests to comment for this story. By the late 1990s, Beijing had had enough of the domestic price wars and local pollution. It started imposing production and export quotas to incentivize more advanced processing of rare earths. The quotas also aimed to cut down on pollution by setting caps on how much mines and refineries could produce and protected the industry from foreign intervention. The quotas created two sets of prices, ""in effect, two-tier pricing, when exports were limited to the rest of the world that resulted in lower rare earth prices for domestic Chinese consumers,"" says Rod Eggert, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines. Samples of rare earth minerals from Bayan Obo mining district are on display at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, on May 17, in Beijing, China. Visual China Group/Getty Images hide caption There was also a second, unintended consequence to the quotas: they created a thriving smuggling industry. Up to 30% of the country's rare earth products in the mid-2000s was illegal, smuggled out of China despite state controls, analysts estimate, because of demand from Japan and the U.S. Then, American and European companies cried foul over the export quotas, and in 2014, the World Trade Organization ruled China could not use them. But China was unfazed. It was already shifting tactics. It would seek global dominance in rare earths not through controlling the volume of outputs, but instead, by controlling which firms could operate. Chinese central authorities dubbed the campaign ""one plus five"": an ambitious, and often ruthless, effort to winnow down the entire rare earth industry to just six consolidated companies. Authorities called the consolidation their ""secret war"" against illegal production. Starting in 2011, provincial authorities were instructed to mount unannounced audits of mines, to seize contraband ore and by-products, and when needed, dynamiting and smashing to pieces illegal mining operations. ""I saw firsthand how the private sector got squeezed out,"" says Ruffle, the investor. Within four years, China declared victory. It announced the closure of dozens of smaller mining and refining companies and guided the mergers of surviving companies into six supersized, mostly state-owned firms, nicknamed the Big Six in China. Through the Big Six, China could now largely control both supply and price. ""Whereas before you had a lot more competition from different producers, now you get very homogeneous pricing,"" says Jan Giese, a Frankfurt-based rare earth trader. ""It's difficult to have competitive bids."" Unlike metal commodities like nickel or gold, there is no independent exchange for buying and selling rare earth elements. Because Chinese companies can cause huge price fluctuations depending on how much they decide to produce or export, investors have been wary of pouring money into new ventures in the U.S., say U.S. refining and mining companies. That has made raising capital to build refining plants a big challenge for American companies trying to break back into the industry. NioCorp CEO Mark Smith talks to a group of investors Oct. 6, 2021, about the prospects for a mine near Elk Creek in southeast Nebraska. Smith is a former CEO of Molycorp. Josh Funk/AP hide caption ""They're putting their money into things like Alphabet and, you know, Amazon and, you know, all the high-flying types of investments and just very, very little, if any, is coming into the mining industry,"" says Smith, the former CEO of Molycorp. Some are still trying. Smith's new venture, NioCorp, is opening new mines and refining capacity for rare earths in Nebraska . Tomas Villalón, chief technology officer and co-founder at Phoenix Tailings, poses for a portrait on June 11. David L. Ryan/Boston Globe/Getty Images hide caption Phoenix Tailings, a startup in Massachusetts, is also among a handful of U.S. companies prepared to refine rare earths, by refining the tailings, or leftover waste, from mining companies. ""We have to be full speed on the gas to make sure we're successful here,"" says Nicholas Myers, one of the co-founders and CEO. The company already makes rare earth magnets for automotive and defense companies, and it is currently building a second plant in New Hampshire which the company says can meet about half of the U.S.' defense needs for rare earth products. For years, Myers says his company struggled to attract investment at the magnitude needed to compete with Chinese firms in scale. This year, things changed, after China implemented a licensing system for foreign companies which caused rare earth exports to plummet. ""Definite tone shift,"" says Myers, ""I think what happened is the end customers, the folks at the big automotive companies or defense primes, realized that they had told their bosses that China would never shut off the supply for them."" But China did shut off that supply. The sudden cutoff galvanized U.S. investor interest in rare earths, Myers says. Phoenix Tailings garnered a major round of investment in May, and now, for the first time in decades, the U.S. may refine rare earth elements again.

climate,"What remains of the ""Tree of Life"" on Sunday, July 20, 2025, is visible off the coast of Efate Island, Vanuatu, after being toppled by cyclones in 2023 and further damaged by an earthquake in 2024. Annika Hammerschlag/AP hide caption THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The UN's highest court is handing down a historic opinion on climate change Wednesday, a decision that could set a legal benchmark for action around the globe to the climate crisis. After years of lobbying by vulnerable island nations who fear they could disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice in 2023 for an advisory opinion, a non-binding but important basis for international obligations. A panel of 15 judges was tasked with answering two questions. First, what are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? Second, what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? ""The stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,"" Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney general of the island nation of Vanuatu, told the court during a week of hearings in December. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis but it affects many more island nations in the South Pacific. ""The agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough,"" Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister for climate change, told The Associated Press. Any decision by The Hague-based court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol, since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. ""What makes this case so important is that it addresses the past, present, and future of climate action. It's not just about future targets -- it also tackles historical responsibility, because we cannot solve the climate crisis without confronting its roots,"" Joie Chowdhury, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, told AP. Activists could bring lawsuits against their own countries for failing to comply with the decision and states could return to the International Court of Justice to hold each other to account. And whatever the judges say will be used as the basis for other legal instruments, like investment agreements, Chowdhury said. The United States and Russia, both of whom are major petroleum-producing states, are staunchly opposed to the court mandating emissions reductions. Simply having the court issue an opinion is the latest in a series of legal victories for the small island nations. Earlier this month, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found that countries have a legal duty not only to avoid environmental harm but also to protect and restore ecosystems. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change. In 2019, the Netherlands' Supreme court handed down the first major legal win for climate activists when judges ruled that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change was a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens.",High
climate,"Experts say there are key questions parents and guardians should ask camp operators about wildfires, flood and heat risk. Danielle Villasana for The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption The deaths of at least 27 children and staff at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas have some parents and guardians questioning the safety of summer camps, especially as global warming increases risks of extreme weather. Part of summer camp's allure is that children are outside in nature. But that can also raise the possibility of heat illness and risks from greater proximity to wildfire or flood-prone areas, says Tracey Gaslin,  chief executive of the nonprofit Alliance for Camp Health in Kentucky. Outside of regulations that apply to all businesses, there are no federal standards that are specific to camps, says Henry DeHart, interim chief executive of the American Camp Association (ACA). The ACA has a national accreditation program that includes some health and safety standards, but it's voluntary and only about 12% of the country's roughly 20,000 camps have participated, he says. On the state level, DeHart says some state agencies conduct camp health and safety inspections. But oversight and protections vary considerably from state to state, and some states have very little regulation. ""There are a lot of states that have very little or no regulation related to camp,"" DeHart says. ""The regulatory framework is wide and varied and, in some places, it's not very robust."" Because of the gaps in the current regulatory framework, some experts on climate-related risks say parents and guardians should ask more detailed questions about campers' safety. Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers , dropped off his 8-year-old daughter at Girl Scout Camp earlier this month, and realized he, too, had many more questions about his daughter's camp's flood precautions. ""Even as a floodplain manager,"" he says, ""I don't think I even had appreciation for what, as a parent, I should be thinking about when sending kids to camp."" Now, Berginnis has a list of points to cover. For parents or guardians sending children to any kind of camp, here are the top questions experts say you should be asking about increased risks of heat, wildfires and floods. Camps can be great for kids, but can also expose them to heat. Children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies. Serhii Bezrukyi/Getty Images hide caption This question is important because heat-related illness and death are major and growing risks in the U.S. —and that threat is often underestimated. Also, children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies, says Rupa Basu,  senior science advisor for the University of California, San Francisco Center for Climate Health and Equity . That makes them more at risk for heat illness, she says. ""I  think that people don't even think of children often as being high risk populations,"" Basu says. "" But they absolutely are."" For these reasons, Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health thinks parents and guardians should be asking camps how they are thinking about heat and hydration. She suggests parents and guardians ask about how the camp's physical site is designed. "" Do you have things like shade structures? Misting systems?"" Gaslin says. ""A really solid infrastructure build is important."" Gaslin also thinks parents and guardians should be asking about how ""climate-aware"" the campers' schedules are. That can look like an activity in a cool location, then an activity outside in a warmer location, then back into the cool, she says. Also it's important to ask about how frequently counselors are reminding campers to hydrate. ""It's really about giving conscious thought to how do we manage that impact of heat,"" she says. "" If we're gonna be outdoors, guess what? Water activities are a great thing to do."" Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP hide caption This question is key because many camps are located in flood-prone areas, Berginnis says. He says – in many ways – that's understandable. ""To me, it makes logical sense that you'd have a lot of camps there because it has really interesting habitats. It has interesting animals and geology and everything, and kids can learn a lot there,"" Berginnis says. But he thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Berginnis says adults can look up risks on this FEMA website . Parents and guardians can also plug in addresses to this database from First Street , a climate risk modeling company. If it's a sleep-away camp, Berginnis says it's important to ask where the kids' sleeping quarters are located. ""If it's an overnight camp, any kind of residential lodging overnight for the kids, if it's in a floodway, that should be a huge red flag right there,"" he says. And he says parents and guardians should ask camps about things like flood sirens and specifics of emergency action plans. "" I would be very blunt with a campground: I wanna know the procedure. If a flash flood warning is declared for the area, what does the camp do? What do the counselors do? So that they can talk it through with you,"" he says in an email. ""Do not be satisfied with a generic answer like 'we have an emergency action plan'. Ask them about specific actions like is there anyone monitoring the weather at night? What are the designated evacuation areas? And if they cannot talk that through with you, again, I would say, that's another red flag."" Tracey Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health says parents and guardians should make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images hide caption As with flood risks, parents and guardians should be asking about emergency action plans and preparedness for wildfire and smoke, Gaslin says. ""Parents can ask camps, do they monitor air quality?"" she says, ""What's their evacuation plan? How are they gonna communicate with families? So families are gonna be able to say, in a moment of crisis, I wanna be able to communicate with you in some way."" Gaslin says it's important to make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Gaslin says parents and guardians should make sure there are always staff monitoring the weather, and at sleepaway camps there should be a solid communication system so at night, individuals are alerted to environmental changes or concerns. That means at least some staff with cell phones and radios at all hours, to monitor for wildfire risk, flash floods, or any other hazards.",Critical
climate,"In the coming months, there will be ""a 'hurry-up-and-buy' 'limited-time-offer' kind of dynamic"" to get government incentives for home solar and other energy-efficient technologies, says Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America. Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption If you've wanted to install rooftop solar panels or buy an electric vehicle in recent years, you've probably been able to get federal money for them in the form of tax credits. But those incentives are going away now that President Trump signed what he's called the "" One Big Beautiful Bill "" into law on July 4. That means in the coming months there will be ""a 'hurry-up-and-buy' 'limited-time-offer' kind of dynamic"" to get these government incentives, says Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America . ""If you want to access them, then really you need to get going,"" he says. Here's what you need to know about what's happening to federal tax incentives for everything from solar panels to heat pumps to electric vehicles, and how much time you have to get that federal money. The country's first major climate policy under the Biden administration secured at least a decade of federal tax incentives for rooftop solar panels, solar water heaters and geothermal heat pumps, says Sean Gallagher , vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association. These technologies not only reduce climate pollution, they also make energy bills more affordable. Scientists say that solar energy plus batteries, as well as energy-efficient appliances, are all reliable technologies that can save households money. Despite the evidence, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers wrote in an email to NPR, ""Instead of subsidizing unreliable energy sources at the expense of hardworking taxpayers, President Trump is unleashing American energy to lower costs to provide further relief for businesses and families."" The tax credit meant homeowners could get up to 30% off the cost of installation or equipment . That tax incentive goes away Dec. 31. Matusiak suggests that people sign a contract with a contractor and pay for and install the project before the end of the calendar year so that they can secure their eligibility for the tax credit. Solar project installation can take a few months and some contractors can have long wait times. That's why he suggests talking to a contractor as soon as possible. If people are buying efficient heat pumps or installing home solar, experts suggest signing a contract with a contractor and paying for and installing the project before Dec. 31 to secure eligibility for the federal tax credit. Tristan Spinski for The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption In addition to the 30% off investments in things like home solar, a federal incentive called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit will also disappear later this year. That credit meant up to $2,000 off heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or biomass boilers on your tax bill. To qualify, appliances must have a high efficiency rating. Some manufacturer websites list tax credit-eligible equipment, as does the Energy Star Product Finder . The tax credit also offered up to $1,200 off home upgrades like new insulation, doors and windows. To qualify for this tax credit, it's not enough to just purchase the equipment. They must be ""placed in service"" during the calendar year — another reason Matusiak suggests moving quickly. Dealers are scrambling to sell qualifying EVs on their lots before the tax credits disappear. ""This is going to be the best time to buy an EV in a long time,"" says Pat Ryan of the car-buying app CoPilot. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Currently, some electric vehicle buyers are eligible for a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for buying or leasing a new EV, and up to $4,000 for a used vehicle. That money is available as a cash rebate at the time of purchase and can be used as a down payment. (Not every buyer and not every vehicle qualifies. You can read more about these credits here .) The new law ends those credits after Sept. 30, over the protests of auto dealers, who said such a rapid change will be disruptive. Rogers at the White House wrote in an email to NPR that ending the tax incentives will ""lower costs and incentivize Made in America products."" Dealers are now scrambling to sell qualifying EVs on their lots before the tax credits disappear. ""This is going to be the best time to buy an EV in a long time,"" says Pat Ryan of the car-buying app CoPilot. ""But, of course, that will go away when prices effectively go up when the rebate ends."" The nonprofit research group Resources for the Future says that its modeling suggests EV sales as a share of the total U.S. market could contract by a third with the end of the credits. That doesn't mean the end of the EV industry, analysts say. ""Automakers have spent literally billions of dollars building out supply chains,"" says Joseph Yoon of the auto data company Edmunds. ""I don't think it's just going to turn around and say, 'Oh, well, that was a fun little experiment.'"" But it could significantly reduce the pace of EV adoption and, as a result, lock in decades worth of future carbon pollution from the gas-powered vehicles being sold today. EV tax credits do boost EV sales, but they require a high government expenditure for each additional sale they encourage; some economic research has suggested that putting money toward chargers is a more cost-effective policy approach. The Trump administration has been working to roll back charger funding, too. The tax-and-spending package will end a credit available to businesses and individuals to help with the costs of installing EV chargers, specifically in low-income or rural areas. That credit, which covers 30% of the installation cost, will end June 30, 2026. Separately, the Trump administration has also frozen funding to build high-speed EV chargers on highways, a move that some states are currently challenging in court . Some local utility companies offer incentives for technologies like heat pumps, residential solar, or insulation, so experts suggest checking in with your local utility. The country's major climate legislation in 2022 gave more than $8.5 billion to states, including Arizona, Georgia, New York and Wisconsin, to help them expand or establish rebate programs for home green technology upgrades. Much of that money is still available. Rewiring America and another nonprofit called The Switch is On have online tools that can help people, in most states, plug in their ZIP codes and incomes to search for the federal, state, local and utility company incentives for which they're qualified. Consumers can also check for incentives at an online database from the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center . Still, because a lot of state rebate money is tied to Biden-era policies, experts also suggest looking into those sooner rather than later. Lowell Ungar , head of federal policy at The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization, doesn't think most states will run out of rebate money this year, but he adds, ""eventually they will run out of money and then there won't be any further federal help.""",Critical
climate,"People swim in the Blanco River by a low water crossing on River Road across from 7A Ranch in Wimberley, Texas, on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption WIMBERLEY, Texas — On a hot and humid mid-July afternoon, cars rumble down the streets of downtown Wimberley. Visitors browse Western-themed shops boasting vintage cowboy boots, cacti and local wine. Fourth of July banners blow in the wind, lining a bridge spanning a small creek that trickles through town. People float on inner tubes in the nearby Blanco River, sipping beers and splashing in the water. Ten years ago, this area was practically unrecognizable. On Memorial Day weekend in 2015, the Blanco River suddenly rose more than 40 feet in the middle of the night, swelling to about a quarter of a mile wide in some places and carrying away nearly everything in its path. At least 12 people were killed, including several children, and hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, according to local authorities. Since then, the small town of roughly 3,000 has focused on rebuilding itself with a potential flood like that in mind, installing new safety measures and alert systems with financial help from the state. But residents and government officials say that the recent deadly, destructive flooding in nearby Kerr County earlier this month has reinforced the need for more preparedness in flood-prone areas like Wimberley. It's also reopened old emotional wounds that still hadn't fully healed. ""It's really hard for us to watch the news right now, because it's just so eerily similar to what we went through that night 10 years ago,"" says resident and business owner Natalie Meeks. Natalie Meeks, co-owner of Water's Point Resort, said that she and her husband are constructing this building to be 3 feet higher than the updated flood maps for the area. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption She and her husband run a vacation resort along the Blanco River, which has been in his family for nearly a hundred years. Today, the river is calm, down a bank and a few hundred feet away from the nearest cabins. But during the flood, Meeks says those cabins ended up 20 feet under water. She and her husband woke up in the middle of the night to phone calls and alerts from people upriver, and rushed to the cabins to pull guests out — in some cases, physically carrying them — trying to find higher ground as the property was swallowed by the river. Loading... ""The only light source we had was lightning and transformers blowing,"" Meeks remembers. ""All you could hear was the ancient cypress trees just snapping, and the river just wasn't stopping."" She says they could hear houses being carried down the river, the people inside screaming for help. There was nothing they could do. All 100 guests and Meeks' family survived that night, but the water washed two of the cabins away. The rest of the structures were severely damaged. Meeks says it took nearly a year just to clear debris after the flood. Since then, it's been one project after another. On the far end of the Meeks' vacation resort, a cabin built on stilts engineered to withstand the rush of future flood waters is in the middle of construction. ""Even after seeing the aftermath of the flood, I didn't comprehend how much time and money it would take to rebuild. It's overwhelming,"" Meeks says, noting that it's not just about the physical rebuilding. ""It's emotional for a long time. It's just a long, long process."" This area in central Texas has long been known as Flash Flood Alley. Droughts cause rivers to run nearly dry for months, sometimes years at a time; heavy rains then make them suddenly overflow. Locals know that floods are part of life; often, they welcome the rain to replenish the water in swimming areas popular with tourists. But so-called 100-year-floods have been happening more frequently , as climate change is driving more intense rain storms across much of the U.S., dropping more water in shorter periods of time. This month's disaster in Kerr County has some of Wimberley's residents thinking about the possibility of another flood in their area, says Mayor Jim Chiles, who was not mayor at the time of the 2015 flood but has been since May 2024. Jim Chiles, mayor of Wimberley, Texas, is photographed at the local Dairy Queen on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Mayor Chiles says he has already had talks with city leaders about putting flooding infrastructure and safety front and center, specifically looking into an audible, citywide alert system like sirens, something many communities in the area are talking about as the death toll from Kerr County's floods has hit at least 130. Many think that might have helped save lives, especially when flooding happens in the middle of the night. ""It's all very premature, but we had an agenda setting meeting,"" he says. ""We put something on there to talk about sirens. Sirens are very expensive, and we gotta figure out how to do that."" He says he's hopeful the state will step in to help with it. Ten years after the 2015 Memorial Day flood in Wimberley, Texas, the Water's Point Resort is in the construction process for replacing the last cabin on the property to be lost during the flood. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption After Wimberley's flood in 2015, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott transferred $6.8 million from a state disaster contingency fund for statewide floodplain management, as well as more river gauges, which monitor the level of the water and send real-time information to weather alert systems. Wimberley's then-mayor Steve Thurber secured several new  gauges for the town, which only had one before the flood and was swept away during the storm. Since then, three have been installed upriver, allowing for much more accurate monitoring. But securing more funding will likely be difficult. Kerr County tried for years — and ultimately failed — to find a way to pay for a new alert system, including sirens. And now, prospects are even more limited, as the Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions of dollars dedicated to help rural communities prepare for disasters. Seventy-seven year-old Jim Venable has lived in Wimberley for most of his life, and while he hopes more infrastructure for flooding and alerts will be put in, he's not optimistic. ""Well, it's always about the dollars, right? You know, how much are the people worth?,"" he says. Jim Venable, 77, a construction superintendent in Wimberley Texas, poses for a portrait at the Wimberley Visitor Center on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Venable was a construction contractor nearby in Austin before the flooding. But afterward, he quit that job to focus on rebuilding Wimberley. ""I think there's still a lot of PTSD after the fact,"" he says, adding that over the Fourth of July weekend, as Kerr County flooded, residents in Wimberley were on edge. ""We're just looking at the rain, and we're just going, well, is that going to hit here or what's going to happen?"" Wimberley sits in Hays County, one of the fastest-growing counties in both Texas and the U.S, according to recent census data . In the summer, the population booms as it welcomes tourists and seasonal summer residents alike, according to town officials. The town is just 40 miles from Austin, making it a popular vacation spot for city dwellers. Venable says he welcomes the extra people coming to enjoy the town, but their presence highlights an even greater need for flood protections. ""We keep inviting people to come in, but we've got to protect them and take care of them, because we're apt to get these storms anytime,"" he says. Gabrielle Snyder, visitor services coordinator with the City of Wimberley, poses for a portrait at the Wimberley Visitor Center on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Gabrielle Snyder works as a visitor services coordinator for Wimberley's tourism department. She says since the flooding in Kerr County, she's had tourists call, concerned about upcoming trips to Wimberley. ""You want to be sympathetic and supportive, but we weren't affected by these latest floods,"" she says. She says part of her job is telling visitors about the need to sign up for flood alert systems and participate in emergency preparedness. But she has to walk a fine line, because the town wants — and needs — people to come. ""Obviously, Wimberley knows better than a lot of communities how devastating this situation is, but at the same time, you know, Wimberley is open,"" Snyder says. A ""Wimberley Strong"" flag flies at the Village Store in Wimberley, Texas, on July 9. The flag was created after the 2015 Memorial Day flood, which killed at least a dozen people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Her house flooded back in 2015, forcing her, her husband and her daughter, who was 9 years old at the time, to quickly grab what they could and evacuate. It was a rental property, and the damage was so severe that it was eventually torn down. For a time, they lived in an RV borrowed from a friend, until they bought a home in a different part of Wimberley — with one major requirement. ""Never again will we live on the river,"" Snyder says. After witnessing what a powerful flood can do, she says she's fine with appreciating the river from a distance.",Medium
climate,"A search and rescue team looks for people along the Guadalupe River near a damaged building at Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images hide caption A search and rescue team looks for people along the Guadalupe River near a damaged building at Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas. It's not just Texas. In the past couple of weeks, communities all around the country have been hit with torrential rains and deadly flash flooding. Extreme weather events like this are expected to become more common as the planet heats up. As climate change increases flash flooding risks, our infrastructure is struggling to keep up. But improvements to that infrastructure will cost billions. NPR's Michael Copley explains how a changing climate drives flooding and how communities and individuals can prepare. And NPR's Laura Sullivan reports on how flood maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency didn't capture the true risks at Camp Mystic, which was devastated by the Texas flooding.
