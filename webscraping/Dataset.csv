0,Politics,"President Trump meets with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Oval Office at the White House on July 22. During a question-and-answer session with reporters while at the meeting, Trump railed against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption The Justice Department on Tuesday said it is in touch with an attorney for Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , to try to arrange a meeting with her in the coming days. President Trump said he thought the development ""sounds appropriate,"" though he also claimed to know nothing about it. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the plan on social media, saying that the department is seeking any information from Maxwell — who is serving time for sex trafficking — as part of its quest to uncover ""all credible evidence"" in the Epstein case. Trump, who was once friends with Epstein, is facing a backlash from supporters who want more information released about the disgraced financier's crimes and his 2019 death by suicide in prison. Trump has dismissed the uproar as a politically driven ""witch hunt"" distracting from his agenda. Asked about the newest development on Tuesday, he told reporters, ""I don't really follow that too much."" His comments to reporters came while he was meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines on trade issues. After the meeting, Trump announced on social media that importers of goods from the Philippines will face a 19% tariff , while U.S. exports to the country will face no tariffs. Trump spent most of his time in the Oval Office question-and-answer session railing against former President Barack Obama and other Democratic figures. Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, recently published materials that she claims show that Obama officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ""It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. So you ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,"" Trump told reporters — the ""nonsense"" referring to the Epstein controversy. Trump said it was ""time to go after people"" in connection to his allegations about the 2016 election. Obama's office issued a rare response, calling Trump's statements ""outrageous"" and noting that conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election had been widely accepted. ""These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,"" Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in the statement. Republicans in Congress have also been grappling with the Epstein issue. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced Tuesday that the House would finish work a day early, canceling votes scheduled for later in the week. That means members will leave town for an annual August recess without a fresh confrontation over Epstein. The schedule change was announced after repeated clashes among Republicans about the files, including a deadlock in the powerful House Rules Committee over an effort by Democrats to force additional votes on the Epstein matter. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales contributed to this report."
1,Politics,"There is an ongoing staffing crunch at the Social Security Administration. Here is one of the agency's field offices, on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption The Social Security Administration (SSA) recently reassigned a small share of its field office employees in an effort to bring down lengthy wait times for the agency's national 800 phone number. Workers at local offices across the country say these reassignments have been disruptive for staff and are increasing wait times for other services. Experts say the tradeoff is a byproduct of a declining Social Security workforce dealing with thousands more Americans who qualify for benefits every day. Thousands of employees have left the government agency in recent months. ""They are in a deep hole of their own creation on staffing and so you just don't have enough people to go around to serve the public,"" said Kathleen Romig, a former SSA official who's now director of Social Security and disability policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). ""And so all you can really do at this point is rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic."" Earlier this month, about 4% of front-line workers were temporarily reassigned to cover the national 800 number, according to the SSA, which added that phone service has improved as a result. ""Thanks to a new telephone platform, most callers are now served quickly through callbacks or automated options, and answer times have already improved significantly in field offices,"" the agency said in a statement to NPR. ""By temporarily assigning a small percentage of field office staff to assist with 800 number calls, we can improve the 800 [number] average speed of answer without disrupting local services."" But Nicole Morio, a field office worker in Staten Island and union representative, said these reassignments have forced front-line staff to take on more work. ""The stress level is probably at a maximum for everyone,"" Morio said. ""At one point I think we were doing the work of 1.8 people. Now it seems as though we're doing the work of 10 to 15."" Monique Buchanan, president of an American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) chapter that represents teleservice center workers, told NPR that the agency has also started to reassign vital claims specialists to the 800 number. Buchanan, who works at a field office in Detroit, said temporarily removing claims specialists from front-line positions is ""directly harmful to the public."" She said these workers finalize applications for people seeking help accessing benefits, such as payments for disabled children. ""These applications are taken through an interview that the claim specialist engages in,"" she said. ""So, the start is the interview with the claims specialist."" CBPP's Romig said staffing up the national hotline might not actually be faster for beneficiaries because so much work is done by claim specialists and other staff at field offices. ""Often customers can't actually complete their business on the phone,"" she said. ""They are going to have to end up in a field office ultimately anyway, or a field office employee is going to have to process that claim that has been taken on the phone or resolve the problem that has been raised on the phone."" The agency recently touted that it had reduced the average answering speed on the 800 number to ""13 minutes, a 35 percent reduction compared to this time last year and over a 50 percent reduction compared to last year's annual average."" But experts say it's harder to track whether the agency is doing better in other metrics. Recently the agency took down various real-time metrics from its website. Romig said it's possible wait times are decreasing as more people are transferred to 800-number duty, but it will surely come at the expense of other vital services. ""Sure, you can get a boost in a particular metric like phone hold times by making a massive shift of staffers to answer the phones,"" she said. ""But you do that by creating a new hole in the field offices, and that's what they're doing."" A Social Security Administration office on Staten Island, N.Y. Olga Ginzburg for NPR hide caption Morio, the Staten Island employee, believes she and other field office workers are being ""prevented"" from properly serving the people who need their help. ""We can't complete all of the things that need to be done,"" she said. ""When you have so little employees and so much work — it's stressful because we get hired to help the claimants. We get hired to help the American public. We're public servants. That's what we do."" Policy experts and front-line workers say that lowering wait times for phone services is a worthy goal, but it cannot be achieved without hiring more staff. Romig said staffing levels at Social Security were already at a decades-long low before the Trump administration began urging people to resign or retire early. According to agency officials, roughly 4,600 employees have left since March. Romig cautioned that staffing ""numbers are very hard to pin down"" because resignations are constantly ""in flux,"" due to the administration's deferred resignation program and ongoing early retirements. During a congressional hearing last month, new SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano told members he does not believe increasing staffing is necessary to improve the agency's services. ""I do agree we must perform significantly better,"" he said, ""but increased staffing is not the long-term solution."" But Jessica LaPointe, who works at a field office in Madison, Wis., and is the president of the local AFGE chapter that represents 25,000 field office workers, said the shuffling of staffing is prompting even more people to leave the agency. ""If they decided not to take the buyout incentives that were offered in March, then now they're just leaving to save their mental health as their work keeps piling up,"" LaPointe said. ""It really is a manufactured crisis as a result of past changes that just continue to just make everything worse, sadly."" Some local field offices only have a few employees, so the loss of one can have a big impact. Juan Daniel Vasquez, who is a generalist technical expert in a field office in Monroe, Mich., said his office had an employee who covered the phones who was recently shifted to the 800 number. He said that since then, all the staff have been tasked with covering the phones, which has added a significant amount of work to everyone's plate. ""It's a lot tougher,"" Vasquez said. ""I'm nearing retirement age and … if you had asked me last year, I would have said I want to stay another five to seven years. Now I'm looking at one to two."" The agency told NPR that Bisignano has been ""visiting field offices and processing centers to hear directly from front-line employees,"" since his confirmation hearing. ""He is committed to giving SSA employees the tools they need to provide best-in-class customer service to the American public and succeed in their roles,"" the agency said in a statement. ""SSA monitors all workload measures in the field offices that are helping answer the 800 Number calls. In addition, we have established field office support units to assist with critical workloads and demands."" But LaPointe said that working conditions for field office workers in the past few months have only gotten worse. ""There's no indication that this is getting better,"" she said. ""We have an agency not listening to the workers."""
2,Politics,"The seal of the Department of Defense at the Pentagon. Mark Wilson/Getty Images hide caption The Department of Homeland Security is preparing to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants who entered the country illegally, as well as to increase the number of immigrants detained at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, according to correspondence between DHS and the Pentagon obtained by NPR. According to the letter, dated July 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the moves, which were requested by DHS the previous month. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, had sought immediate access to Camp Atterbury, a National Guard base in Indiana, and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, a base in New Jersey, from the Defense Department. ICE is also seeking to detain more immigrants without legal status at Guantánamo Bay prior to their final removal from the United States. ""DoD approves this support through September 30, 2025, subject to ICE maintaining a 24/7 oversight presence at each site to maintain custody and provide overall supervision of each site,"" stated the letter from Executive Secretary Anthony Fuscellaro to DHS acting Executive Secretary Andrew Whitaker. ICE staff and contractors will be responsible for all care and handling of the migrants, including meals, medical screening, transportation and medical services, according to the correspondence obtained by NPR. Neither DHS nor the Defense Department has yet responded to questions about the letter. On his first day in office, President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, enabling DHS to gain access to DOD's military resources. During congressional testimony, Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, told lawmakers he did not expect DHS to repay the Pentagon for their costs. The approval letter notes that DHS will pay DOD for any costs associated with migrant detention at McGuire Field, the Air Force base in New Jersey. The request for the use of additional military bases, and expansion at Guantánamo, comes as the Trump administration has pushed to arrest and detain more people in the country without legal status. DHS has nearly 57,000 people in immigration detention, though it only has about 41,000 beds . The department has sought out contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, local jurisdictions, and the use of military bases to detain migrants. By June, Guantánamo was holding about 500 migrants , though until now the base could only accommodate about 200 . In the letter to lawmakers obtained by NPR, Hegseth said that the use of the bases in Indiana and New Jersey for immigration detention ""will not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or other military requirements, including National Guard and Reserve readiness."" Camp Atterbury in Indiana will assist with removal operations out of the Chicago area; McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey will support Newark. Guantánamo Bay is designated to help with detentions and removals from Miami. The plan laid out by DHS calls for space for up to 1,000 people at the Indiana and New Jersey bases and to approximately double the capacity at Guantánamo to 400 people. DOD rejected a request from DHS for air transportation assistance until it got more details. In May, DHS asked for 20,000 National Guard members to assist ICE in its operations ranging from ""night raids"" and ""rural interdictions"" to guard duty at detention facilities. The Pentagon has already approved some 700 guard members to assist in Florida, Louisiana and Texas. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that hundreds more National Guard troops are expected to be called up to assist operations in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia. The Democratic congressional delegation in a statement condemned the terms of the use of the New Jersey base. ""This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources,"" they said in the statement. ""Using our country's military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful."" In addition to using the military, the Trump administration is expected to be able to scale up its detention capacity due to an influx of funding from Congress. The recent tax and spending bill set aside $45 billion for immigration detention centers and $30 billion for more ICE personnel, transportation costs and to maintain existing ICE facilities."
3,Politics,"Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO James Quincey says the company will ""expand our trademark Coca-Cola product range with U.S. cane sugar"" to give Coke fans a new option. President Trump mentioned the plan last week, saying Coca-Cola had ""agreed"" to use real cane sugar, similar to its recipe for Mexican Coke. Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption Coke drinkers who want to avoid corn syrup sometimes opt for Mexican Coke, which is made with cane sugar. But the drink's U.S. fans will have a new option later this year. ""We're going to be bringing a Coke sweetened with U.S. cane sugar into the market this fall,"" Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO James Quincey said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday. The company announced the change in the quarterly earnings report it released Tuesday, describing the new drink as an expansion of its product line. Quincey said the new offering would ""complement"" Coca-Cola's core portfolio of drinks, suggesting it could arrive as an alternative, rather than a replacement, for its flagship Coke product. Coca-Cola's move comes a week after the White House issued a statement by President Trump saying he had been talking to the soft drink giant about using cane sugar rather than high-fructose corn syrup in its signature drink. ""I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You'll see. It's just better!"" Trump said. Trump is a noted fan of Diet Coke, a product line that is mainly sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame . The president's involvement in the recipe of a popular drink was noted in Tuesday's call, but officials did not go into detail about what, if any, communications they had with the White House. ""As you may have seen last week, we appreciate the president's enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand,"" Quincey said. When asked whether he and Trump had discussed the idea of using cane sugar in Coke, the CEO replied in part, ""engagement with government is a piece of what goes on."" The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment on whether the Trump administration had contacted the company about cane sugar. The use of domestic sugar aligns with Trump's economic priorities, as he has imposed steep tariffs on dozens of foreign nations. The source of the sugar could also affect the drink's cost: The U.S. sugar industry enjoys substantial market protections against foreign rivals. ""The U.S. has high trade barriers against imported sugar,"" as NPR's Scott Horsley has reported . ""As a result, the price of sugar in this country is usually about twice what it is on the world market."" While some U.S. consumers see Mexican Coke as a unique Coca-Cola product that uses cane sugar, Quincey noted that the company already uses the sweetener in several drinks. ""Actually, we use cane sugar in a number of our other brands in the U.S. portfolio, from lemonade to teas, some of the coffee stuff, some of the Vitamin Water drinks,"" he said. But, he added, Coca-Cola wants to explore new options to suit consumer preferences. Trump's push for cane sugar over corn syrup has not gone over well with the U.S. corn industry. Corn Refiners Association President and CEO John Bode predicts that an increase in using U.S. cane sugar will lead to a rise in foreign cane sugar imports. Bode said in a statement to NPR, ""Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and expand the trade deficit."" While President Trump famously adores Diet Coke , cane sugar has emerged as a popular issue for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a key proponent of the administration's Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, movement. ""MAHA is winning,"" Kennedy tweeted last month , applauding the Steak 'n Shake restaurant chain's move to ""offer Coca-Cola with real cane sugar in glass bottles."" But just three months ago, Kennedy said that in the U.S., sugar ""is poisoning us."" And in March, Kennedy hailed West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey for seeking ""a SNAP waiver to get sodas and other sugar drinks off of food stamps."" While he has spoken out against sugar , Kennedy has acknowledged that the government isn't likely to be able to remove it from Americans' diets. He has also condemned the use of additives such as high-fructose corn syrup, artificial dyes and artificial flavors in food. High-fructose corn syrup has been a regular target of health experts for years, thanks to its ubiquity in sweet drinks and processed foods. ""In 2004, a widely read report suggested high fructose corn syrup was a major cause of the obesity epidemic, and documentaries such as Fast Food Nation and King Corn piled on,"" as NPR reported in 2012 , noting that despite the report being recanted by its authors, the idea took hold. But whether sugar or syrup are used to sweeten food and drinks, the potential health risks for American consumers are virtually the same, according to David M. Klurfeld, an adjunct professor in the Department of Applied Health Science at the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington. ""There is overwhelming evidence that cane or beet sugar have almost no difference from HFCS [high fructose corn syrup] in composition and no difference in any health effects,"" Klurfeld tells NPR. High-fructose corn syrup and table sugar have fairly similar proportions of glucose and fructose, he says, adding that when sugar is added to soft drinks with acidic pH levels, their chemical compositions become even more alike. ""The data linking HFCS with obesity or any adverse health effect are observational epidemiology,"" Klurfeld says. ""This cannot prove cause and effect because of confounding variables — people who drink the most soda are heavier, exercise less, have different diets, etc."" But, he adds, ""Randomized controlled studies comparing sugar and HFCS for effects on blood glucose, lipids, or weight loss have all show no differences."" NPR's Scott Neuman contributed to this report."
4,Politics,"Rep. Ritchie Torres (right), D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill July 17, 2023 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America hide caption The Republican-controlled Texas legislature is looking to redraw congressional maps to give the GOP an edge in next year's midterm elections — and New York Rep. Ritchie Torres says Democrats have no choice but to fight back. ""To just simply stand by passively and allow Republicans to rig the process in their favor is actually a form of complicity. It's the opposite of protecting democracy,"" Torres told Morning Edition . With Texas still reeling from the deadly July 4 floods, the state legislature plans to approve a partisan redistricting of Texas' congressional map . The move is driven by President Trump's desire to win five more seats for Republicans next fall. Some Democrats want states where their party is in control to redraw their House district lines and cancel out Texas' plans or gain their own advantage. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is one of the Democrats who's expressed this interest, and during a press conference last week he said, ""I'm not going to be passive at this moment."" Torres says this scenario ""underscores the need for a national system in which we take the politics out of redistricting."" ""Republicans should be careful what they wish for,"" he said. ""The Republicans in Texas have the intention of strengthening the Republican seats, but could have the effect of weakening them in a climate that is likely to be more favorable to Democrats."" NPR's Steve Inskeep and Torres further discussed the Republican Party's redistricting agenda and why he believes the Democratic Party must ""counter their cheating or become complicit."" The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Steve Inskeep : What's the basic idea you're promoting? Rep. Ritchie Torres : Well, I would describe it not as ruthlessness, but as fairness. In an ideal world, there would only be a redistricting at the beginning of the decade at the decennial census. You know, no one in the Democratic Party wants a redistricting arms race. But if Republicans are going to rewrite the rules in the middle of the game and redraw maps in Texas, which could yield up to five seats, then we have no choice but to respond and reciprocate. To stand by passively would mean unilateral disarmament. Inskeep : Can you do that in New York? Torres : It's theoretically possible, but, you know, we face constraints in New York. Inskeep : There's a constitutional provision in New York. Torres : There's constitutional provision that might be lacking in Texas, but we have no choice but to try, because Republicans are essentially cheating or essentially rewriting the rules in the middle of the game. And either we counter their cheating or we become complicit. Inskeep : You're saying that you would like your state's leaders even in New York, despite the constitutional provisions, to try to find some way around them and see if you can get a different electoral map. Torres : We should attempt to redraw maps in a fair manner within the constraints of the Constitution. Yes. Inskeep : People watching this from the outside are perhaps thinking, 'We're being manipulated here. All the same votes, and you slice us up in different ways and come up with a different result.' Torres : Look, I think it underscores the need for a national system in which we take the politics out of redistricting. Democrats are in favor. We've passed legislation in every legislative session where we were in the majority, only to have it obstructed and opposed by the Republicans. But if one side is playing by the rules and the other side is pursuing power at all cost, that's a losing proposition for the Democratic Party. And it's a losing proposition for democracy. Inskeep : There are a number of different purposes that you can serve with redistricting, and one of them is maximizing the number of seats your party gets. But another is incumbent protection, which, as I understand, is more common in redistricting. The party in power will protect their seats, and you have fewer and fewer seats that are truly in play anywhere in Congress. How do you think that has affected the business that the House of Representatives does that you're in? Torres : Well, the principle that govern the original Texas redistricting was incumbency protection. And Republicans should be careful what they wish for. The Republicans in Texas have the intention of strengthening the Republican seats, but could have the effect of weakening them in a climate that is likely to be more favorable to Democrats. Inskeep : I guess we should explain the math. Instead of X number of seats that are 60% Republican, you have more seats that are 52% Republican. So they might lose one. Torres : And those seats could easily become more competitive, like Jared Golden in Maine, who has said, ""Be careful what you wish for,"" because he is a Democrat who won in a Trump district. Inskeep : What do you think about as you hear Democrats being described, even six months into the Trump presidency, as being confused, in disarray, still trying to figure out their loss in 2024, still trying to figure out a message for 2026 and beyond. Torres : I think the Democratic Party is a work in progress. We have a message which is affordability, to focus like a laser on lowering the cost of living, which was the dominant issue in the New York City mayor's race. But look, we're facing an unprecedented challenge to our economy, our democracy, our society. I mean, Donald Trump has no regard for the rules and norms of democracy. And so there's no formula for the kind of resistance that we're mounting against Trump 2.0, which is far more vindictive, far more aggressive, far more emboldened than anything we've seen before, including Trump 1.0. Inskeep : Do you think that there has been a problem in finding a new generation of leaders for the Democratic Party? Torres : I think a new generation of leadership is emerging. There are younger members who are assuming committee chairmanships like Robert Garcia [D-Calif.] for Oversight or Angie Craig [D-Minn.] for Agriculture. So the new guard is rising, and we have a new generation of members of Congress who are adapting to the world of new media. You know, as Democrats, if we have confidence in our message, we have to be willing to take that message to every corner of the alternative media ecosystem. And that's something we're starting to do. Inskeep: Is that something that Republicans did better in the last election? Torres : I think Donald Trump is one of the masters of alternative media. And for a long time, we're playing catch up. The digital piece was edited by Obed Manuel. The radio version of this story was edited by Ally Schweitzer and produced by Milton Guevara and Nia Dumas."
5,Politics,"In Montana, one man says Medicaid and the drug coverage he gets through it are what allow him to work. But a raise he has gotten could mean he loses Medicaid, so he says he decided to ""fudge the numbers."" Oona Zenda/KFF Health News hide caption MISSOULA, Mont. — As congressional Republicans finalized Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, one man who relies on that government-subsidized health coverage was trying to coax his old car to start after an eight-hour shift making sandwiches. James asked that only his middle name be used to tell his story so that he wouldn't lose health coverage or be accused of Medicaid fraud. He found his food service gig a few weeks into an addiction treatment program. The man, who is in his late 30s, said his boss ""hasn't been disappointed."" ""I'm a good worker,"" he said with a grin. James can get the prescription drugs that help him stabilize his life and hold down that job through Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program that covers people with low incomes or disabilities. Those drugs curb his desire for alcohol and treat long-standing conditions that exacerbate his addiction, including bipolar and insomnia disorders. But he hasn't qualified for the program in months, ever since his work hours increased and he received a raise of about $1 an hour. He exceeds his income eligibility limit of about $21,000 per year by roughly $50 a week. James said that despite his raise, he's struggling to cover routine expenses, such as keeping his car running and paying his phone bill. He said he can't afford the care he needs even on the cheapest insurance plan available to him through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace or through his job's health insurance plan. Even paying $60 a month for his sleep medications — one of six prescriptions he takes daily — is too expensive. ""I only saw one option,"" James said. ""Fudge the numbers."" James hasn't reported his new income to the state. That puts him at odds with congressional Republicans who justified adding hurdles to Medicaid by claiming the system is rife with waste, fraud and abuse. But James isn't someone sitting on his couch playing video games, the type of person House Speaker Mike Johnson and others said they would target as they sought to impose work requirements. Medicaid provides health coverage and long-term care to more than 70 million people in the United States. Those who study safety-net systems say it's extremely rare for enrollees to commit fraud to tap into that coverage. In fact, research shows that swaths of eligible people aren't enrolled in Medicaid, likely because the system is so confusing. And nearly two-thirds of people on Medicaid in 2023 had jobs, according to an analysis by KFF , a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Those transitioning off Medicaid may qualify for other subsidized or low-priced health plans through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace. But, as in James' case, such plans can have gaps in what care is covered, and more comprehensive private plans may be too expensive. So James and an unknown number of other people find themselves caught between working too much to qualify for Medicaid but earning too little to pay for their own health care. James considers himself to be a patriot and said that people shouldn't ""use government funding to just be lazy."" He agrees with the Republican argument that, if able, people should work if they receive Medicaid. “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” James Hiding his hours on the job from the government bothers him, especially since he feels he must lie to access the medical care that enables him to work. ""I don't want to be a fraud. I don't want to die,"" James said. ""Those shouldn't be the only two options."" On July 4, Trump signed into law the major tax and spending bill that makes it harder for low-income workers to get Medicaid. That includes requiring beneficiaries to work or go to school and adding paperwork to prove they meet a minimum number of hours on the job every six months. ""It's going to hurt people, whether they're playing by the rules or not,"" said Ben Sommers , a health economist at Harvard University. ""We see this vilification of mostly very hardworking people who are really struggling and are benefiting from a program that helps them stay alive."" James said he initially declined his raise because he worried about losing Medicaid. He had previously been kicked off the coverage about a month into his rehab program after finding work. To stay in the sober-living program he otherwise couldn't afford, James said, he dropped just enough hours at work to requalify for Medicaid and then soon picked up hours again. If he didn't earn more, he said, he had no chance of saving enough money to find housing after graduating from the treatment program. ""They'll give you a bone if you stay in the mud,"" James said. ""But you have to stay there."" That problem — becoming just successful enough to suddenly lose Medicaid — is common. It's called a benefit cliff, said Pamela Herd , who researches government aid at the University of Michigan. ""It just doesn't make any sense that someone gets a dollar pay raise and all of a sudden they lose all access to their health insurance,"" Herd said. She said a partial fix exists called continuous eligibility, which guarantees an individual's Medicaid coverage for a specific period, such as a year or longer. The goal is to give people time to adjust when they do earn more money. Continuous eligibility also helps maintain coverage for low-income workers with unpredictable hours and whose pay changes month to month. But Congress has moved in the other direction. Under the new law, policymakers limited windows of eligibility for able-bodied adults to every six months. That will put more people on the program's eligibility cliff, Herd said, in which they must decide between losing access to coverage or dropping hours at work. ""It is going to be a nightmare,"" Herd said. Those federal changes will be especially difficult for people with chronic conditions, such as James in Montana. Not that long ago, James wouldn't have been breaking the rules to access Medicaid because his state had 12-month continuous eligibility. But in 2023, Montana began requiring enrollees to report any change in their income within 10 days. James is proud of how far he has come. About a year ago, his body was breaking down. He couldn't hold a spoon to eat breakfast without whiskey — his hands shook too hard. He had alcohol-induced seizures. He said his memories from his unhealthiest times come in flashes: being put on a stretcher, the face of a worried landlord, ambulance lights in the background. James recently graduated from his treatment program. He's staying with a relative to save money as he and his girlfriend try to find an affordable place to rent — though even with Medicaid, finding housing feels like a stretch to him. He's taking classes part time to become a licensed addiction counselor. His dream is to help others survive addiction, and he also sees that career as a way out of poverty. To James, all his progress rides on keeping Medicaid a bit longer. ""Every time I get a piece of mail, I am terrified that I'm gonna open it up and it's gonna say I don't have Medicaid anymore,"" he said. ""I'm constantly in fear that it's gonna go away."" As of mid-July, officials hadn't noticed the extra $50 he makes each week.

7,Politics,"The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speaks on the telephone after encountering a white mob protesting against the Freedom Riders in Montgomery, Ala., on May 26, 1961. On Monday, the Trump administration released a trove of records about King's assassination. Express Newspapers/Getty Images/Hulton Archive hide caption The National Archives has published thousands of newly digitized documents relating to the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as part of a directive by President Trump. The release on Monday follows through on an executive order Trump signed days into his second term, requiring the release and declassification of records connected to King's murder and the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy — tragedies that have been the subject of curiosity and conspiracy theories for decades. It was not immediately clear what new historical insights would be found in the trove of documents . The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement Monday that the release included more than 230,000 files relating to King's assassination, including information connected to the man who was convicted of murdering him, James Earl Ray. ""The documents include details about the FBI's investigation into the assassination of MLK, discussion of potential leads, internal FBI memos detailing the progress of the case, information about James Earl Ray's former cellmate who stated he discussed with Ray an alleged assassination plot, and more,"" the ODNI statement said. King's family responded to the release by saying the files must be viewed ""within their full historical context,"" adding that the late civil rights leader was ""relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)."" ""While we support transparency and historical accountability, we object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods,"" King's children, Martin Luther King III and Bernice A. King, wrote in a statement . Members of King's family have long disputed Ray's conviction , arguing that he was set up, a point repeated in Monday's statement. ""As we review these newly released files, we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted,"" they said. In a statement announcing the release, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, ""The American people deserve answers decades after the horrific assassination of one of our nation's great leaders."" The Trump administration's decision to publish the files comes as the White House faces growing pressure from Trump's base to also release additional information related to disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In March , the administration also released thousands of records relating to the assassination of JFK."

9,Politics,"President Trump, accompanied by Tulsi Gabbard, speaks after Gabbard is sworn in as director of national intelligence on February 12. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images hide caption The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, has published the latest in a series of recent Trump administration reports aimed at scrutinizing years-old intelligence community conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. For years, President Trump has spread disinformation about those conclusions, calling the entire Russia investigation a ""hoax,"" despite supporting evidence that has been systematically reviewed by intelligence agencies, lawmakers and Department of Justice lawyers. On Friday afternoon, ODNI published a press release asserting that its director, Tulsi Gabbard, ""revealed overwhelming evidence"" that President Obama and his national security officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" to launch a ""years-long coup against President Trump."" Gabbard echoed those conclusions across social media platforms X and Truth Social, and in interviews on Fox News in the days that followed. Among the materials Gabbard declassified are emails and memos published under the banner of the new ""Director's Initiatives Group,"" formed to ""execut[e] President Trump's Executive Orders aimed at rebuilding trust in the [Intelligence Community]."" In those files , Obama officials exchange correspondence about Russian attempts at election interference, concluding that it was unlikely Russian hackers would successfully compromise physical election infrastructure or alter vote totals without detection but might be successful in influencing voter confidence in the election. ""There is no indication of a Russian threat to directly manipulate the actual vote count through cyber means,"" wrote an ODNI official whose name was redacted in a newly published email. ""However, as seen in recent media reporting, any cyber activity directed against the election infrastructure is likely to have an effect on public confidence,"" they continued. Gabbard also released a timeline that outlines events leading up to the 2017 assessment that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 election. The timeline focuses on the conclusions by intelligence community officials that Russia likely had not and would not use cyber means to directly compromise voter systems or change vote tallies. Gabbard argues that these conclusions are hypocritical and poke holes – if not directly contradict – the intelligence community's 2017 assessment that Russian attempted to influence the election. But Obama officials never claimed that Russian hackers had successfully changed votes or hacked election infrastructure at scale. The 2017 assessment focuses on Russian influence , from social media disinformation networks, hack-and-leak campaigns, Russian bot farms and other more psychological efforts made by Russian actors. Intelligence community experts acknowledge that Russian hacking targeting election infrastructure was likely limited and aimed at gathering intelligence. Democrats were quick to criticize the new ODNI publication as contradictory to previous reviews of the assessment, as well as dishonest and politically motivated. ""This is utter nonsense,"" wrote Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. ""It is sadly not surprising that DNI Gabbard, who promised to depoliticize the intelligence community, is once again weaponizing her position to amplify the president's election conspiracy theories,"" wrote Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on X. Meanwhile, earlier in July, CIA Director John Ratcliffe published a separate report reviewing the CIA's internal processes while compiling the 2017 assessment. On X, he claimed that Obama officials had ""manipulated intelligence"" in an effort to ""get Trump."" However, like the newly declassified emails and memos, the CIA report doesn't appear to directly contradict the central thesis of the 2017 assessment: that Russia attempted to influence the American public and their perceptions of the 2016 election. The CIA's ""lessons-learned"" review of the analytic procedure behind the 2017 assessment identified several recommendations for stricter compliance with CIA standards, but ultimately said that the actual conclusions made in that assessment were ""defensible."""

11,Politics,"Democratic lawmakers have reintroduced a set of bills called the ""Safer Beauty Bill Package,"" aiming to bring safety and transparency to the largely unregulated cosmetics industry. Nadia Audigie/Getty Images hide caption Personal care, salon and beauty products sold across the U.S. are subject to little federal oversight — and many have been found to contain toxic ingredients. The average American adult uses about 12 personal care products a day, Consumer Reports says , resulting in exposure to an average of 168 chemicals. Those can include formaldehyde, mercury, asbestos, lead and parabens, which have been linked to cancer, brain damage and reproductive harm. Women of color are thought to use twice as many products, according to Consumer Reports . Despite mounting scientific research into the dangers posed by toxic chemicals, little has been done to ban them or at least label them on cosmetics. A group of Democratic lawmakers hopes to change that. On Wednesday, Reps. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, Doris Matsui of California and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced the "" Safer Beauty Bill Package ,"" a set of four bills designed to update what they call ""an increasingly outdated set of federal cosmetics laws."" Each focuses on a different aspect of product safety, from banning the most toxic ingredients in everyday beauty supplies to creating protections for the women of color and salon workers who are disproportionately exposed to them. ""More than 10,000 chemicals are used to make beauty and personal care products,"" said Schakowsky , who authored all four bills. ""We owe it to consumers to ensure the beauty and personal care products they use daily are safe."" This is an updated version of a similar package that lawmakers first introduced in 2021. In 2022, then-President Biden signed into law the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA), which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) calls the most significant expansion of its authority to regulate cosmetics since its creation in 1938. The law gave the FDA power to do things like issue mandatory recalls, require adverse event reporting and suspend manufacturers' facility registration. But lawmakers and consumer safety advocates say it did little to actually improve the safety of beauty and personal care products. The lack of federal action has driven some states — including Vermont, California, Washington and Oregon — to enact their own bans on dozens of chemicals from cosmetic products in recent years. The FDA did not comment when asked about the legislation. The Personal Care Products Council — a leading cosmetics trade industry — told NPR in a statement that it is ""fully committed to upholding the highest standards of safety, quality and transparency for cosmetics and personal care products."" The group says on its website that it has ""a long history of science and safety best practices, often going beyond what is required by law."" In a 2024 statement responding to concerns about PFAS, known as ""forever chemicals,"" in personal care products, the group said that all cosmetic ingredients are subject to the same federal safety requirements, adding that ""member companies take their responsibility for product safety ... very seriously."" Consumer Reports says that the Safer Beauty Bill Package addresses gaps in federal regulation that were not addressed by MoCRA, ""including ingredient safety and transparency, which is what consumers care about most."" The legislation has been endorsed by over 150 companies and organizations , many focused on environmental and consumer health. Janet Nudelman, director of program and policy at Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, said in a statement that the bill package ""matches the new high bar for cosmetic safety established by the states"" and will help the FDA ""get some of the most toxic chemicals on the planet"" out of beauty products. ""These bills recognize that everyone deserves protection from unsafe cosmetic exposures regardless of where they live, shop, or work,"" she added. Studies have linked hair products primarily marketed toward Black women, like straighteners and relaxers, to an increased risk of certain cancers and other health risks. Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption Years of scientific research has linked toxic chemicals in hair, makeup and other personal care products to health problems including hormone disruption, respiratory issues, adverse reproductive outcomes and cancer. That's especially worrisome for Black and Latina women, whom research shows are more often exposed to dangerous ingredients like formaldehyde in nail and hair products. A Consumer Reports study published in March found cancer-causing ingredients in 100% of the 10 most popular synthetic hair products used in braids, extensions and other hairstyles popular with Black women. Another study, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters in May, found that formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing products are present not only in hair relaxers but in a wide range of beauty products that get even more regular use, including soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner and eyeliner. And a report released Thursday by Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, looking at the dangers of fragrances specifically, found that over 98% of fragrance chemicals either lack basic safety data or are classified as high or potentially high concern by scientific authorities. ""A gaping federal labeling loophole combined with a self-regulated fragrance industry allows for dozens — sometimes even hundreds — of chemicals to hide under the words, 'fragrance,' 'parfum,' 'aroma' or 'flavor' on the product labels of beauty and personal care products,"" the report reads. Consumer advocates say product safety is becoming even more urgent, as girls turn to makeup and skincare products at a younger age and breast cancer rates on the rise among women under 65. While the European Union has banned over 2,400 toxic chemicals from personal care products, the FDA only restricts about a dozen . Advocates and lawmakers want the U.S. to start catching up. ""It's time to close the loopholes that allow toxic chemicals in the products we use on our bodies every day,"" Schakowsky said. The bills have been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for consideration, the first step in the legislative process. Here's what they would do if passed: Janette Robinson Flint, co-founder and executive director of Black Women for Wellness, said in a statement that she hopes Congress will ""meet this moment with a sense of urgency."" ""Women, girls, and all people in this country deserve better from our legislators, regulatory agencies (EPA/FDA), and corporations,"" she said."
12,Politics,"President Donald Trump speaks as first lady Melania Trump, left, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott listen during a roundtable discussion with first responders and local officials at Hill Country Youth Event Center in Kerrville, Texas, during a tour to observe flood damage July 11. Jacquelyn Martin/AP hide caption Just over two weeks since floods in the Texas Hill Country killed more than 130 people, Texas lawmakers start a special legislative session today with the aim of funding recovery and protecting from future disasters. This spring they failed to pass a bill that could have led to increased spending for emergency warning systems. Now special committees of the House and Senate plan to go to Kerrville, the area with the most flood fatalities, to hear about the life-saving help local governments need. They'll be working while there's uncertainty at the national level about the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an agency in doubt after calls from members of the Trump administration that it be cut back or eliminated. There were already plans for a special session this month on the totally different topic of laws to regulate sales of hemp products. But Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, in his proclamation calling the session, led with flood-related matters. And disaster relief wasn't all he added to the session, which can last up to 30 days. He's also including a list of controversial GOP priorities. They include redrawing congressional voting districts in ways that would impact the 2026 midterm elections and tightening laws against medication abortion. Here are some of the issues at stake. Abbott is asking that lawmakers improve early warning systems, strengthen communications infrastructure and provide relief money for areas impacted by the recent flood or future floods. One of the first ideas for what exactly lawmakers should do came from Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the leader of the Texas Senate, when he spoke to Fox News after the storm . ""Had we had sirens along this area up and down, the same type of sirens that they have in Israel when there's an attack coming that would have blown very loudly, it's possible that that would've saved some of these lives."" Patrick said. He wants those in place by next summer, when youth camps like the ones destroyed in the flooding will be operating again. Bills already filed include proposals to tighten flood safety standards at youth camps and to create a flood disaster guide for volunteer organizations. To hear from flood victims themselves, lawmakers are traveling to Kerrville, Texas, along the devastated banks of the Guadalupe River, for a public hearing July 31. Members of a search and rescue team visit a memorial wall for flood victims in Kerrville, Texas. Eric Gay/AP hide caption The federal government's ability to help the state - or not - will factor into the session. President Trump and Gov. Abbott are Republican allies and the state's counting on federal help. In Abbott's call for the session, he proposed using state money to match disaster relief grants from FEMA. But Trump, and others in the administration, have proposed eliminating FEMA. Abbott himself has been critical of the agency and is on a council formed to change it. In June, Trump said the agency should, ""give out less money."" But Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, said recently President Trump told him, ""anything Texas needs, the answer is yes."" If Texas lawmakers end up relying on FEMA help, it could increase pressure to preserve the agency. But there's also the possibility that the close Trump-Abbott alliance could lead to workarounds that send federal money to Texas while FEMA itself and its ability to help other states is scaled down. Experts say that when lawmakers get together to explore options, they shouldn't limit themselves to North America to find solutions. For the best examples, Upmanu Lall, director of the Columbia Water Center at Columbia University in New York, says lawmakers should look overseas. ""China is installing sensors for rainfall, sensors for depth of water in the street, sensors for the depth of the water in sewer system, and in the rivers,"" Lall said. He says those sensors can send back data to give emergency officials a real time picture of what's taking place. With the state focused on the floods in the Hill Country, there could be competition from other flood-prone areas where officials have been requesting funds for years. The Texas Water Development Board published The State Flood Plan in December. It ranks the state's most urgent flood prevention needs, which would altogether cost over $54 billion . Houston Democratic state Rep. Ann Johnson is on the House committee tasked with finding solutions for the impacted areas. She says the focus can't just be on addressing this one disaster. ""I think Kerrville is a reminder that there's a reason we need to get this stuff done and passed in preparation for the next event,"" she said. ""Because it's no longer a question of whether or not Texans are going to suffer an extreme weather event, it's just when,"" During a press conference Abbott said, ""We're going to work on every single solution to make sure things like this don't happen again, not just in this community, but in other river basins across the state also."" But those solutions will have to fit within a large but still limited budget. There are few hotter political issues than the maps that outline districts for members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Abbott has added that to the session's to-do list. It comes at the urging of Trump. On Tuesday, he told reporters at the White House he believes redistricting could help Republicans pick up as many as five seats in the upcoming midterm Congressional elections. Democratic State Rep. Johnson thinks the attempt to redistrict outside the usual 10-year census cycle is illegal. ""That should concern all Texans. We are not in a redistricting cycle,"" she said. Usually, redistricting is done after census figures are released early in the decade. Abbott has also asked lawmakers to tighten state laws against abortion rights or, as the proclamation says, ""further protecting unborn children."" This appears to include proposals to make it easier to sue people or companies that send abortion medication to the state. The governor's call also opens the door to legislation limiting access for transgender people to some ""sex-segregated spaces,"" like bathrooms or locker rooms. And then there's the original reason the session was considered before the flood. That was to pass a ban on sales of THC products to people under 21, among other regulations for the state's booming hemp industry. Abbott vetoed a bill that would have banned hemp products outright.

13,Politics,"A naturalization ceremony at the Nevins Library in Massachusetts on Oct. 30, 2024. David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images hide caption Over the past two decades, it's become a tradition for each president to craft their own speech to welcome new citizens. These video messages, played at naturalization ceremonies nationwide, are brief but experts in presidential rhetoric say they are important — not only are they meaningful to newly naturalized citizens, but they provide insight on how each president values immigration and their broader vision for the country. President Trump, whose second term has been marked by his hard-line approach to immigration, released a new naturalization ceremony video last month. ""Today you receive one of the most priceless gifts ever granted by human hands. You become a citizen of the United States of America,"" Trump said. Trump went on to welcome new citizens into the ""national family,"" adding that they now have a responsibility to ""fiercely guard"" and preserve American culture, including the freedom of speech, religion and the right to bear arms. "" That fits into his larger narrative, but that's not usually what you see at an American naturalization ceremony.  It's much more of a celebration and I'm not saying that Trump doesn't celebrate those ideas, but it's less celebratory than his predecessors,"" said Jason Edwards, a communications professor at  Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts who has studied presidential welcomes to new citizens. Only a handful of presidents have delivered remarks at naturalization ceremonies, either through video or in person. That includes Gerald Ford, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Edwards said most have centered their message on how immigrants enrich and renew the country, whereas Trump's remarks emphasized what the U.S. has to offer new citizens. ""No matter where you come from, you now share a home and a heritage with some of the most exceptional heroes, legends and patriots to ever walk the face of the Earth,"" Trump said in his speech. "" There's no heterogeneity, there's no celebration of diversity, there's no celebration of past immigrants,"" Edwards said. A spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, which released Trump's video, said his message is ""an essential one"" and would be part of naturalization ceremonies moving forward. That message: ""U.S. citizenship is a privilege and reserved for those who respect our laws, culture, and history,"" USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said in a press release about the video. In both his first and second term, Trump avoided using the word ""immigrant"" altogether in his video message congratulating new citizens. That also strayed from his predecessors, who often called the U.S. a nation of immigrants and acknowledged the journey that newcomers took to become American citizens. Biden, for example, spoke about immigrants' sacrifices and courage, adding that his own ancestors immigrated to the U.S. from Ireland. ""I don't wanna say it's an erasure, but it's wanting to kind of erase that idea — you're no longer an immigrant, you are a citizen,"" Edwards said, referring to Trump's remarks. Instead, Trump shifted the focus to the idea of a ""national family,"" which often implies loyalty and obligation, according to Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha, a political science professor at the University of North Texas. Eshbaugh-Soha added that the emphasis on family and the explicit reference to the right to bear arms are consistent with traditional conservative values — which is also unusual for ceremonial speeches like naturalization events. ""That idea of American family is very much in line with this idea of America first,"" he said. Generally, Trump's rhetoric on immigration has intensified during his second term, especially during his most recent presidential campaign, according to Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political rhetoric at Texas A&M University. "" The metaphors that he used about immigration, whether it was an invasion, whether immigrants were poisoning the blood of the nation and things like that,"" Mercieca said. ""Those are very salient ways of talking about immigration and  very different from the ways that previous presidents have done."""
14,Politics,"Students walk through Harvard Yard. Jesse Costa/WBUR hide caption In a packed federal courtroom on Monday, lawyers for Harvard University argued that the federal government's freeze of more than $2 billion in grants and contracts is illegal and should be reversed. Harvard's attorneys said the federal funding cuts imposed by the Trump Administration threaten vital research in medicine, science and technology. The school's lawsuit aims to block the Trump administration from withholding federal funding ""as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard."" The Trump administration has said it froze the funding because Harvard violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by failing to address antisemitism on campus. At the hearing in the U.S. District Court in Boston, Judge Allison D. Burroughs appeared to push back on that argument, asking the administration's lawyer about the relationship between cancer research and combating antisemitism. The only lawyer in court for the Trump Administration, Michael Velchik, argued that the administration has the right to cancel government grants at any time if it decides that an institution doesn't align with its priorities – and said that combating antisemitism is an administrative priority. Velchik framed the issue as one about finances and told the judge that the government has the ability to simply give the research funding to another institution. ""Harvard wants billions of dollars. That's the only reason we are here. They want the government to write a check,"" Velchik said, who is himself a Harvard alum. The hearing concluded with Judge Burroughs saying she needed time to review the paperwork from both parties and would then issue a decision, though it's unclear when that may come. After the hearing President Trump took to social media saying , ""The Harvard case was just tried in Massachusetts before an Obama appointed Judge. She is a TOTAL DISASTER, which I say even before hearing her Ruling."" He went on to say he intended to end the practice of giving Harvard billions, and instead to give it to other colleges and universities. ""How did this Trump-hating Judge get these cases?"" he wrote. ""When she rules against us, we will IMMEDIATELY appeal, and WIN."" Whichever way Judge Burroughs decides, legal experts NPR talked with don't expect a full resolution anytime soon, given the likelihood that either side will appeal a ruling. Outside the courthouse, about a hundred Harvard alumni, students and supporters gathered for a rally. ""What President Trump is doing is so clearly wrong,"" said James McAffrey, a Harvard senior studying government. McAffrey is a co-founder of Students for Freedom, a student group that pushes the university to continue standing up to the federal government. ""I'm from Oklahoma, a very red state, I'm a very proud American. I believe in freedom of speech. I believe in the American dream,"" he said. ""When you're starting to attack freedom of speech, that's anti-american. He said the administration's cuts to research funding at Harvard have ripple effects. ""There's research that echoes all the way back to Oklahoma and impacts my home city of Oklahoma City in major ways. This research is important."" Colleges and universities around the country are watching this case closely. Dozens of other institutions have also had millions in federal grants frozen. ""Across the higher ed landscape, across the entire sector, institutions recognize that what happens in this case will really have a profound impact,"" says Jodie Ferise, a lawyer in Indiana who specializes in higher education and represents colleges and universities. ""There is nothing different about Harvard University than there is about some Midwestern, smaller private college,"" Ferise says. ""Everyone is watching and worrying about the extent to which the federal government is seeking to control the higher education sector."" Harvard's arguments In court documents and at Monday's hearing, Harvard's lawyers made several arguments. The first is that the administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act , known as APA, which says that federal agencies cannot abruptly change procedures without reason. They argue that there are procedures, established by Congress for ""revoking federal funding based on discrimination concerns,"" that the government did not follow. They argue the government didn't follow proper procedure when dealing with an alleged violation of federal civil rights law. This argument is a common complaint of groups suing the Trump administration, with more than 100 lawsuits citing alleged violations of the APA, according to the nonprofit Just Security, which tracks legal challenges to Trump administration actions. Harvard also argues that there is no connection between alleged antisemitism and shutting down federal medical and scientific research. ""The Government has not—and cannot—identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,"" Harvard's complaint says. The complaint also charges that the government is violating the First Amendment, which, it says, ""does not permit the Government to 'interfere with private actors' speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance.'"" Harvard claims the government is interfering with its academic freedom by telling the university how to hire, how to admit students and access student files without subpoenas. The Trump administration accuses Harvard of failing to protect Jewish students. After Harvard refused to comply with a list of demands, the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism , a multiagency group within the administration that includes representatives of the Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services departments, announced it was freezing funds. ""The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families, is coming to an end,"" Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement when the cuts were announced. ""Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege."" The government argues that Harvard didn't follow federal law – including allegedly fostering antisemitism on campus and engaging in Illegal discrimination through DEI efforts. As a result, the government argues, the university is not entitled to these research dollars. ""The Trump administration is looking at Harvard and saying, 'you failed to do things,' "" explains Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "" 'You failed to protect Jewish students. You failed to comply with a federal law. And as a result of those failures, we get to do something in return. We get to cut off the federal spigot of funding.' "" And while Levinson and other legal experts NPR talked to say that federal power is there, the question for the court will be: Did the Trump administration go about using that power in the right way? The more than $2 billion at stake in this case supports more than 900 research projects at Harvard and its affiliates. Those grants fund studies that include Alzheimer's prevention, cancer treatment, military research critical for national security and the impact of school closures on mental health. Kari Nadeau is a professor, physician and researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who studies ways of reducing the risk of near-fatal allergies in infants. When the government cancelled her grant, she says she lost about $12 million dollars for the study. ""We've had to stop our studies and our work,"" Nadeau says, ""and that has really had a huge ripple effect for everyone. Not just us, but the people we serve, the teams we work with, the trainees that we train, as well as many staff across the country."" She's especially concerned with families who signed up to participate in the clinical trial, which was supposed to last for 7 years. ""When you take a therapy away from people, and especially in this case, children, and you put them at risk for a near fatal disease like food allergy, that is a safety issue,"" she says. ""These families could be put into additional harm."" The future of her project may come down to the outcome of this case. She says she's cautiously optimistic. Legal experts NPR talked with suggested that Harvard may have a strong case. ""Will Harvard win in Boston? There's a good chance of that,"" says Ferise. ""But is that gonna settle the matter? That's probably not the case. It will go to an appeal, it will go to the Supreme Court. So a win, while it would be welcome to colleges, won't feel like the end of the story."""

President Trump is threatening to intervene in a deal for a new stadium. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images hide caption President Trump is threatening to derail a plan to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., for the Washington Commanders football team unless the team changes its name back to the previous name. ""The Washington 'Whatever's' should immediately change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. ""There is a big clamoring for this."" The football team dropped the longtime name in 2020 after many years of criticism that it was racist toward Indigenous people . Trump also called for the Cleveland Guardians baseball team to change their name back to the Cleveland Indians. That name change was announced in 2021 . ""Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen,"" Trump wrote, without offering evidence. ""Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen. Their heritage and prestige is systematically being taken away from them."" Suzan Harjo, a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes who fought for decades to get the team's name changed, told NPR in 2022 that the ""R-word"" was connected to racist attitudes that perpetuated ""emotional and physical violence"" against Native Americans. ""When I was a girl, you barely could make it through your young life without getting attacked by a bunch of white people — whether they were boys or girls or men or women. And they would always go to that word,"" she said. In a later post, Trump threatened to scuttle the Commanders' plans for a new stadium, which would move the team from its current location in Maryland back to the nation's capital after renovating an antiquated stadium on federal property. ""I may put a restriction on them if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a stadium in Washington,"" Trump wrote . Congress gave the city control over the site of the proposed new stadium last December, which former President Joe Biden signed into law in January . The D.C. Council is now considering a multibillion-dollar plan to redevelop the property for the team. It's unclear how Trump could intervene with the project. Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office said in an email that the mayor had no comment. The Commanders did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. The Cleveland Guardians declined comment."

Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images hide caption The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to shutter the agency's scientific research arm that provides expertise for environmental policies and regulations, as part of the Trump administration's continuing downsizing of the federal government. The agency is closing the Office of Research and Development , which analyzes dangers posed by a variety of hazards, including toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, indoor air contaminants, water pollution, watershed destruction and drinking water pollutants. The office also manages grant programs that fund universities and private companies. ""Under President Trump's leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while powering the great American comeback,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement announcing the plan Friday. ""This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars."" The cut, part of a plan to cut 23% of the EPA's staff, will save $748.8 million, according to the agency. It said the EPA would at the same time add ""laboratory functions and hundreds of scientific, technical, bioinformatic, and information technology experts to EPA's air, water, and chemical offices on top of the thousands of scientists and engineers employed by EPA within those program offices."" In addition, the agency is moving ahead with a plan to create a new ""Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions,"" the EPA says. That new office ""will allow EPA to prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,"" according to the agency. The EPA said in a statement to NPR that some employees were being reassigned and that no employees have been laid off yet, but 'that is the next step in the process.'"" Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the ranking member on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, condemned the cuts. ""Administrator Zeldin has finally confirmed what he has denied for months and months — the destruction of the Office of Research and Development,"" she said in a statement . ""The Trump Administration is firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people. The obliteration of ORD will have generational impacts on Americans' health and safety. This is a travesty."" Kyla Bennett, director of science policy for the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility ( PEER ), said eliminating the ORD ""will not only cripple EPA's ability to do its own research, but also to apply the research of other scientists. This [reduction in force], together with the slashing of travel and training budgets, will leave EPA flying blind and unable to use the best available science. These short-sighted cuts will ultimately affect every American, and it is despicable."" The American Chemistry Council , which represents chemical manufacturers, said the organization ""supports EPA evaluating its resources to ensure American taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively to meet the Agency's statutory requirements. If necessary, that includes shifting resources from certain offices."" In January, the agency had 16,155 employees, but has reduced that number to 12,448, the EPA says.

17,Politics,"Voters fill in their ballots in the upper house election at a polling station Sunday, July 20, 2025, in Tokyo. Eugene Hoshiko/AP hide caption TOKYO — Exit polls show Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba 's ruling coalition is likely to lose a majority in the smaller of Japan's two parliamentary houses in a key election Sunday, worsening the country's political instability. Voters were deciding half of the 248 seats in the upper house, the less powerful of the two chambers in Japan's Diet. Ishiba has set the bar low, wanting a simple majority of 125 seats, which means his LDP and Komeito Liberal Democratic Party and its Buddhist-backed junior coalition partner Komeito need to win 50 to add to the 75 seats they already have. That is a big retreat from the 141 seats they had pre-election, but media surveys predict big setbacks for Ishiba. Exit poll results released seconds after the ballots closed Sunday night mostly showed a major setback for Ishiba's coalition. Japan's NHK television projected a range of 32-51 seats for the prime minister's coalition, while other networks projected it would win just over 40 seats. A poor performance in the election would not immediately trigger a change of government because the upper house lacks the power to file a no-confidence motion against a leader, but it would certainly deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan's political stability. Ishiba would face calls from within the LDP party to step down or find another coalition partner. Soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top issues for frustrated, cash-strapped voters. Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors have also emerged as a key issue, with a surging right-wing populist party leading the campaign. Sunday's vote comes after Ishiba's coalition lost a majority in the October lower house election, stung by past corruption scandals, and his unpopular government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through parliament. It has been unable to quickly deliver effective measures to mitigate rising prices, including Japan's traditional staple of rice, and dwindling wages. U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations and the lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba. A voter casts a ballot in the upper house elections at a polling station Sunday, July 20, 2025, in Tokyo. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) Eugene Hoshiko/AP hide caption Ishiba has resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect for a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition. Frustrated voters are rapidly turning to emerging populist parties. The eight main opposition groups, however, are too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative. The emerging populist party Sanseito stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance, with its ""Japanese First"" platform that proposes a new agency to handle policies related to foreigners. The party's populist platform also includes anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles. Conservative to centrist opposition groups, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, the DPP, and Sanseito have gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats' expense. The spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media has triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents. The LDP has almost continuously dominated Japan's postwar politics, contributing to its political stability and social conformity. Voters are divided between stability and change, with some voicing concern about escalating xenophobia. Yuko Tsuji, a 43-year-old consultant, who came to a polling station inside a downtown Tokyo gymnasium with her husband, said they both support the LDP for stability and unity and voted ""for candidates who won't fuel division."" ""If the ruling party doesn't govern properly, the conservative base will drift toward extremes. So I voted with the hope that the ruling party would tighten things up,"" she said. Self-employed Daiichi Nasu, 57, who came to vote with his dog, said he hopes for a change toward a more inclusive and diverse society, with more open immigration and gender policies such as allowing married couples to keep separate surnames. ""That's why I voted for the CDPJ,"" he said. ""I want to see progress on those fronts."""
18,Politics,"Abby DuFour, WCHG news reporter and afternoon host of the show DuFour Du Jour , cues up the next song in her broadcast at the station in Hot Springs, Va. Kristian Thacker for NPR hide caption DUNMORE, West Virginia — When President Trump pushed to slash federal funding for public media, he said a key reason was because he thinks PBS and NPR are politically biased . But some of those hardest hit by Congress' decision last week to clawback $1.1 billion in federal funds are small radio operations that provide local news and information to rural communities. One is Allegheny Mountain Radio , a cooperative of three stations which cover Pocahontas County, West Virginia as well as Bath and Highland counties in Virginia. Allegheny Mountain is not an NPR member station, but it does run NPR's daily newscast, a quick run down of top stories. Allegheny Mountain's mix of programming includes local news and information as well as gospel, country and blues shows. A recent episode of the Noon Hour Magazine reported on a $5,000 signing bonus to attract new teachers and how the energy demands from data centers could eventually affect this remote region where people sometimes have to drive 60 miles to reach the nearest shopping center. Allegheny Mountain Radio's WVLS, which sits in the picturesque mountain town of Monterey, Va., provides local government news, funeral notices and information on missing pets to listeners in areas where it can be hard to access cell phone signals and the internet. Kristian Thacker for NPR hide caption The show also featured a regular segment on missing pets, in this case a dilute calico with a stripe down its nose. ""I have read a lost and found pet report for an emu that was wandering around the county, "" recalls Scott Smith, Allegheny Mountain's general manager. Allegheny Mountain relies on funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for up to 65 percent of its annual budget of about half a million dollars. Smith says his stations do have financial reserves, but the hole in their budget could become existential. ""There is only so long that you can continue to exist when you are operating in the red,"" says Smith, who has a long gray beard that stretches nearly to his belt buckle. ""At some point that well runs dry."" Scott Smith, Allegheny Mountain Radio's general manager, sits in the main broadcasting studio at station WVLS in Monterey, Va. Smith says Congress' decision last week to slash public media funding could wipe out up to 65 percent of his budget. Kristian Thacker for NPR hide caption Smith hopes to raise more money to try to fill some of the gap, but he worries that eventually he may have to cut staff or even shut a station. Allegheny Mountain is among nearly 70 small radio stations in states such as Alaska, Kentucky, Texas and Mississippi that have relied on the CPB for at least 30 percent of their annual budgets. Smith says the radio cooperative helps knit together a region where it isn't easy to connect because of the mountains and the spotty access to phone and internet. Much of its coverage area lies inside the Monongahela and George Washington and Jefferson National forests. During a nearly 75-mile drive from an interstate to WVMR, which sits in Dunmore, W. Va., an NPR reporter had no internet connection. Some people here say they really value the news and community information Allegheny Mountain provides. Jay Garber, mayor of the town of Monterey, Va ., says the radio remains the fastest way to let citizens know about everything from water main breaks to road closures. Jay Garber, mayor of Monterey, says the community relies on the radio for daily, local news and information. ""Without the radio station, we're kind of in the blind here, locally,"" he says. Kristian Thacker for NPR hide caption ""It's our only source of local, daily information,"" says Garber, sitting in his office along Main Street. ""We have a newspaper that's printed once a week, so without the radio station, we're kind of in the blind here, locally."" Just down the block from the mayor's office, Jean Hiner is finishing up her french fries at Highs Restaurant, where customers are encouraged to ring a bell on the way out if they like the food. Hiner, 79, who used to raise sheep, says Allegheny Mountain also provides essential information about the people here. ""My husband and I would sit and listen to the radio and then an obituary would come on and we didn't know that that person had died,"" Hiner recalls. ""Then we'd get ready real quick and we'd go to the funeral home for the evening when the family was meeting."" Not everyone loves Allegheny Mountain's coverage. Danny Cardwell.  a station coordinator and reporter, recalls that someone became so angry with reporting on contentious county supervisors' meetings back in the mid-2010s that they dumped manure in front of the radio station — not once, but twice. Danny Cardwell, Allegheny Mountain Radio's social media coordinator and station coordinator for WCHG in Hot Springs, says killing public media funding is a big mistake. ""Getting rid of these local stations is throwing away the baby with the bath water,"" he says. Kristian Thacker for NPR hide caption Smith says he's had unpleasant exchanges with listeners who took issue with Allegheny Mountain simply because it plays NPR's newscast, which accounts for just 40 minutes of the radio stations' daily offerings. One person wrote on Smith's Facebook page that Allegheny Mountain deserved to lose federal funding on that basis alone. ""I literally had an old friend tell me that Allegheny Mountain Radio deserved to die because we played 'liberal propaganda,'"" says Smith. NPR executives deny accusations of political bias and have defended the network's reporting. Smith adds that parts of Central Appalachia are more diverse than some outsiders realize and that many here like NPR. In fact, he says, one listener reached out last week and offered to personally pay for the newscast. A sign for Allegheny Mountain Radio's WVLS station stands along U.S. Route 250 in Hightown, Va. Kristian Thacker for NPR hide caption People in the three counties Allegheny Mountain Radio covers voted for President Trump by a margin of nearly three to one last year. Cardwell says in an attempt to punish NPR, Trump is only hurting some of those who have supported him. ""Getting rid of these local stations is throwing away the baby with the bath water,"" says Cardwell. Cardwell sees the targeting of public media as part of a broader assault on facts that includes the defunding of universities in an attempt to control the nation's political narrative. ""These stations and all the institutions that produce data and information, those are the institutions under attack,"" he says. Allegheny Mountain Radio staff say they don't blame NPR for their loss of federal funding, but they do say they have become a casualty of America's polarized politics.

19,Politics,"Attorney General Pam Bondi, left, listens as President Donald Trump, right, speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption After intense public pressure and criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the political spectrum, President Trump has called for a federal judge to release grand jury testimony related to the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of sexually trafficking children. The Department of Justice has also formally asked the federal court judge who was assigned to the Epstein case to unseal the testimony. In a motion filed Friday to the Southern District of New York, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote: ""Given the public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation into Epstein, the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information."" On Saturday morning, Trump posted about the request on his Truth Social account, writing : ""I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval. With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request. It will always be more, more, more. MAGA!"" However, Trump continues to distance himself from Epstein, and denies that he had any involvement in the allegations against the disgraced financier, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal child sex trafficking charges. (Epstein's death was ruled a suicide . Ghislaine Maxwell, who helped run the trafficking ring that ensnared young teenagers, was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022.) This past week, Trump lashed out at both Democrats and members of his own party interested in the Epstein materials, calling them ""stupid"" and ""foolish"" in comments he made at the White House. On Wednesday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social account: ""Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bull*****' hook, line, and sinker."" FILE - This March 28, 2017, file photo, provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein. New York State Sex Offender Registry/AP hide caption Epstein's imprisonment and death have spurred a number of conspiracy theories, including one amplified by several prominent individuals who serve in the Trump administration that his death is evidence that the government is actually run by a ""deep state"" determined to undermine the president. Much of the public pressure to release materials related to Epstein has come from both media influencers and rank-and-file Trump supporters, many of whom have been intensely interested in such conspiracy theories, and some of whom have publicly aired their disappointment that Trump had seemed to renege on campaign-era assurances that he wanted to see the files released. On Friday, President Trump filed a federal lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, accusing the news outlet of defaming him in a report published Thursday that said Trump had written a birthday card to Epstein in 2003 that included sexually suggestive language and a lewd drawing. The president maintains that he did not draw or write any of these materials. The suit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, alleges that the Journal ""falsely claimed that he [Trump] authored, drew, and signed a card to wish the late–and utterly disgraced–Jeffrey Epstein a happy fiftieth birthday."" The suit asks for at least $10 billion in damages and also names the Journal 's parent company, NewsCorp (which also includes Fox News); NewsCorp chief executive Robert Thomson; and Khadeeja Safdar and Joseph Palazzolo, the two Journal reporters who wrote the story. Republican and Democrat lawmakers alike have been calling for the release of files on the Epstein case. On Thursday, AP reported that House Speaker Mike Johnson said , ""All the credible evidence should come out."" On Tuesday, Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie introduced a discharge petition to force a House vote on releasing the complete Epstein files. ""We all deserve to know what's in the Epstein files, who's implicated, and how deep this corruption goes,"" Massie wrote in a post on X. On Weekend Edition Saturday , Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) also called for all files related to Epstein to be released. ""We need full transparency,"" Khanna said. ""We need the interview memos to see which rich and powerful men were involved with Jeffrey Epstein. We need to see the emails, the texts. We need to of course protect victim identity. But the president promised this when he campaigned. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, promised this."" Khanna said that the need for transparency with the Epstein documents goes far beyond the particulars of this case. ""It goes to the heart of trust in the government,"" Khanna said. ""It goes to the heart of whether our government is granting impunity to the rich and the powerful who may have abused, assaulted, abandoned young girls, or whether we're going to stand up for children and stand up for truth. And many people view it as an issue of whether our government in Washington has been corrupted."" Earlier this month, the DOJ released a two-page memo saying that after an ""exhaustive review,"" it and the FBI found no evidence that Epstein kept a ""client list"" of people involved in the alleged sex trafficking, or that Epstein blackmailed prominent and powerful associates. The DOJ memo contradicted past statements made by Bondi."

21,Politics,"A banner showing an image of President Trump hangs on the side of the U.S. Department of Agriculture building in Washington, DC. The department wants states to turn over records about tens of millions of people who have received federally-funded nutrition assistance by July 30. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption When Julliana Samson signed up for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to help afford food as she studied at the University of California, Berkeley, she had to turn in extensive, detailed personal information to the state to qualify. Now she's worried about how that information could be used. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has made an unprecedented demand to states to share the personal information of tens of millions of federal food assistance recipients by July 30 , as a federal lawsuit seeks to postpone the data collection. USDA is requiring states turn over identifying information on all SNAP recipients and applicants since 2020, ""including but not limited to"" names, dates of birth, addresses and Social Security numbers, as well as the dollar amount each recipient received over time. States that do not comply with USDA's data demand could lose funds. Samson is one of the more than 40 million people who receive SNAP benefits each month. Their personal data has remained within their states' control, but the USDA's demand would change that. She and three other SNAP recipients, along with a privacy organization and an anti-hunger group, are challenging USDA's data demand in a federal lawsuit, arguing the agency has not followed protocols required by federal privacy laws. Late Thursday, they asked a federal judge to intervene to postpone the July 30 deadline and a hearing has been scheduled for July 23. ""I am worried my personal information will be used for things I never intended or consented to,"" Samson wrote recently as part of an ongoing public comment period for the USDA's plan. ""I am also worried that the data will be used to remove benefits access from student activists who have views the administration does not agree with."" Some senators share her concern. In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Thursday, 13 Democratic senators, led by California's Sen. Adam Schiff, slammed a public notice the USDA issued that grants itself broad authority for using SNAP recipients' data. ""This policy would turn a program that feeds millions of Americans into a tool of government mass surveillance,"" the senators wrote. They called on the agency to reverse course and warned otherwise the USDA ""will be at serious risk of violating federal law."" When asked for comment on the senators' letter, an unnamed USDA spokesperson responding from a media email account wrote the agency's public notice for its proposed SNAP database ""is open for comment until July 23."" The USDA's sweeping data demand comes as the Trump administration is taking wide-ranging and novel steps to collect personal data on people living in the U.S. and link data sets across government agencies for immigration enforcement, identifying potential fraud and waste, and other purposes that are still unknown. A new federal agreement, for example, allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement to access Medicaid recipients' personal information, including ethnicities and addresses, to locate immigrants who might be subject to deportation. The agreement, which was first reported by the Associated Press and was later confirmed by the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, on CBS , follows the revelation that federal health officials shared Medicaid enrollees' data from a handful of states with the Department of Homeland Security without notifying states or seeking consent. Federal agents detain a man after his court hearing in immigration court at a federal building in New York City on July 9, 2025. The federal government's push to collect data on nutrition assistance recipients has advocates worried that the government safety net programs will be harnessed for immigration enforcement. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images hide caption The USDA first publicized its data request in early May, saying the information would be used to ensure program integrity. The agency cited President Trump's March 20 executive order that calls for ""unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding"" including from ""third-party databases"" to stop waste, fraud and abuse. The agency has since stated the plan also relates to Trump's February 19 executive order aimed at ensuring immigrants without legal status do not receive public benefits, and has said it will use the data to verify enrollees' immigration status. Some categories of noncitizens who used to qualify for SNAP no longer do after Trump's tax and spending bill that passed earlier this month. Though immigrants living in the country without legal status are ineligible for SNAP, they can apply for benefits for their U.S. citizen children. NPR asked USDA if the agency would make SNAP recipient data available to ICE for immigration enforcement. In response, an unnamed USDA spokesperson referred to a provision of the Food and Nutrition Act, the federal law that created SNAP, that says information shall be shared with local, state or federal law enforcement to investigate SNAP-related violations. The USDA temporarily paused its data request in late May after the federal lawsuit challenging it was initially filed. The agency then issued a Systems of Record Notice , or SORN, on June 23 for the proposed new data set, a step required by the federal Privacy Act of 1974 that allows the public to comment on the agency's plan. Plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit submitted public comments and argued in court filings that the USDA's notice is unlawful, since they say the agency's description for how it intends to use SNAP recipients' data is incompatible with the Food and Nutrition Act that created the food assistance program. The personal information of more than 40 million people currently use federal nutrition assistance programs administered by states, including addresses, Social Security numbers, and more could be collected by the federal government soon. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images hide caption The USDA's notice asserts broad authority to share SNAP recipients' data with other agencies and law enforcement. But the law that created SNAP says records shall be shared with law enforcement only to investigate SNAP-related violations, with an exception for locating fugitives. ""Congress, when they were passing the Food and Nutrition Act, understood how sensitive this information is,"" Nicole Schneidman, a technology policy strategist at the legal nonprofit Protect Democracy, and one of the attorneys behind the lawsuit, told NPR. ""And the bottom line is that this administration can't attempt to basically override that by issuing this overbroad SORN."" Samson, one of the plaintiffs, wrote in her public comment that the federal government is proposing to use her data in ways that she never consented to when she signed up. ""I shared my sensitive information with California with a clear understanding that it was only to determine my eligibility for SNAP and make sure I didn't break any of the rules of being on SNAP,"" she wrote in her public comment. ""Now, this notice from the federal government says they plan to share my data with other federal agencies for reasons that have nothing to do with finding errors and fraud in the SNAP program. I never agreed to that, and it scares me."" She and other plaintiffs in the case argue the notice is defective because it does not spell out the full extent of the data the agency intends to collect. Another plaintiff, Catherine Hollingsworth, a 76-year-old SNAP recipient in Alaska, wrote in her comment that she has shared extensive personal information with the state, including scans of IDs, medical records and bank information, and she wondered if the federal government might ultimately get those records, too. ""I am very worried that with each additional data transfer data [sic], it will be less secure and that my information will be severely compromised,"" she wrote. An unnamed USDA spokesperson told NPR the agency does not comment on litigation, and referred to the Department of Justice, which did not return a request for comment. Earlier this month, USDA announced its data collection would begin July 24, the day after the comment period for its SORN is slated to close. Plaintiffs argue the USDA's timeline has not left any time to consider public comments and incorporate feedback. While several states have indicated they plan to comply with USDA's demand, others have expressed concerns. ""We will protect Marylanders' personal information by following the law,"" Maryland Department of Human Services press secretary Lilly Price told NPR in an email. ""We are currently reviewing the USDA letter."" The lawsuit over the SNAP data collection is one of more than a dozen lawsuits pending over the Trump administration's efforts to access and aggregate Americans' sensitive data. Last week, twenty states sued over the Medicaid data disclosure to DHS . In response to an NPR inquiry about the agreement to share Medicaid data with ICE, an unnamed spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services wrote in a statement, ""With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them."" The statement went on to criticize California for offering health benefits to immigrants without legal status through a state-run program. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat who is leading the lawsuit to stop the federal government from sharing Medicaid data, said this week he was ""deeply disturbed"" to learn of the new agreement that gave ICE access to the data. ""The President's efforts to pull personal, private, and unrelated health data to create a mass deportation machine cannot be allowed to continue,"" Bonta said in a statement."
22,Politics,"The Texas Legislature passed a bipartisan law aimed at clarifying the emergency exception to the state's abortion ban this spring. The law is called The Life of the Mother Act. Gabriel C. Pérez/KUT News hide caption AUSTIN, Texas — Across the 18 states that have banned or tightly restricted abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , questions have persisted over when doctors can perform abortions in medical emergencies. State lawmakers out of Texas say a newly passed law called the Life of the Mother Act should clarify for doctors in the state where to draw the line. Reproductive rights advocates and medical groups are watching to see if it saves lives. In Texas , abortion is only permitted when a woman's life or one of her major bodily functions is at risk, but doctors have said it's unclear what qualifies under such emergency medical exceptions. The penalties are steep if they get it wrong: In Texas, doctors face a sentence of up to 99 years in prison, fines and the loss of their medical license. Dr. Emily Briggs is a family physician in Central Texas who says she fields a lot of questions about the ban from young doctors who train at her practice. ""We have physicians in training — medical students and residents — who are choosing not to go through their training in Texas for a multitude of reasons,"" she says. Many new doctors are worried they can't get a full education in Texas because they can't train in abortion care under the ban, Briggs says. Some are concerned about the impact of the ban on their own health as they consider starting families. That's part of why Briggs supported the new law in Texas. ""I think this is a great step in the right direction,"" she says. The new law came after years of activism by doctors and patients, as well as reporting from ProPublica that showed at least three Texas women have died after delays in care. An investigation from the outlet also found that rates of sepsis have risen among pregnant women under the state's abortion ban. A diverse coalition contributed to the writing of the bill, including medical associations and anti-abortion groups. The new clarifications: The bill was filed by Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes , the same lawmaker who authored the Texas Heartbeat Act , a six-week abortion ban that went into effect in 2021, prior to the repeal of Roe v. Wade . ""Most hospitals, most doctors, are getting this right. But this bill is to remove any excuse, remove any question, and also to make sure that doctors are trained,"" Hughes said in March. Amanda Zurawski was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that sought to clarify the emergency medical exception to Texas' abortion ban. She says the state's new law is a ""very, very, very tiny step forward."" Michael Minasi/KUT News hide caption Several states have tried to clarify their emergency exceptions in the past, both through legislative actions and rules released by state medical boards. Some, like Florida , have released lists of medical conditions that would make an abortion lawful. Kentucky passed a law this spring that listed examples of qualifying conditions, including ectopic pregnancy and excessive bleeding. But Briggs says this tactic can be limiting. ""The laundry list approach is not appropriate, because there could be a nuance,"" she says. ""What if her nuanced care is slightly different from what has been deemed appropriate by the legislation?"" Texas' new law does strengthen protections for when a doctor performs an abortion to treat a couple of specific conditions, including ectopic pregnancy and premature rupture of membranes. That's in addition to the provisions about immediacy, burden of proof and discussions among doctors and patients. What the law does not do is add any new exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies — a sticking point for some medical groups and reproductive rights advocates. Some, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said they would oppose any bill that kept Texas' abortion ban in place. Mary Ziegler, a law professor and abortion law expert at the University of California-Davis, says the impact of the new law may depend on how individual doctors read it. ""I think some physicians will take these clarification bills as a kind of reassurance that the state is not just kind of going to go hog wild in prosecuting physicians in emergency cases,"" she says. But Ziegler also predicts that more risk-averse doctors will feel the law doesn't offer enough clarity to offset the steep penalties that still exist. The Life of the Mother Act also requires doctors to receive medical education on the state's abortion laws. While this could be a valuable resource, Ziegler says it could also make doctors feel they are being held to an even higher standard. ""You could see physicians reading this bill and saying, I have to be even more sure this patient is in dire straits to intervene,"" she says. Women who have been affected by Texas' abortion ban are also weighing whether the law can lead to meaningful change, including Amanda Zurawski, who lost part of her reproductive system and nearly died of sepsis when she was denied prompt abortion care. She became the lead plaintiff in the high-profile Zurawski v. Texas lawsuit , which asked the courts the clarify the state's abortion ban. The court ultimately ruled it's not its role to clarify state laws. Zurawski says she sees Texas' new law as ""a very, very, very tiny step forward,"" but that the legislation ultimately does not make her feel safer. ""I can't get pregnant again, because of what the state of Texas made me go through. If I could, I would not remain in Texas for a pregnancy. There's no way,"" she says. Ziegler says it will take time to determine whether the law will prevent more cases like Zurawski's, as doctors and hospital administrators learn about the legislation and are faced with real-time medical emergencies. ""There's a kind of rubber meets the road question about whether these actually prevent tragedies or not,"" Ziegler says, ""and I think it's too early to say."""

Davidoff Studios Photography/Getty Images hide caption Donald Trump and his girlfriend (and future wife), former model Melania Knauss, financier (and future convicted sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein, and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago club, Palm Beach, Florida, February 12, 2000. One of the narratives at the heart of President Trump's political movement is this: American society is dominated by a shadowy group of elites, and those elites are deeply corrupt. Nothing represented that theory more than the case of Jeffrey Epstein. He was a man most people had never heard of initially, with a private plane and a private island. Acquainted with the world's most powerful people: British royalty, U.S. presidents. A man who ultimately died in jail...by suicide, according to authorities... before the case against him went to trial. Epstein's case and his death bred skepticism and conspiracy theories – especially among supporters of Donald Trump. Now, some of Trump's most ardent supporters are attacking his Justice Department's decision not to release all of the files related to the Epstein case. Trump says nobody cares about Epstein.

0,Science,"Newborn babies lie in bassinets in the nursery of a postpartum recovery center in upstate New York in 2017. A new study examined births over decades to find tendencies toward having all girls or all boys. Seth Wenig/AP hide caption Couples who've been surprised by a string of baby boys or baby girls could be forgiven for wondering whether the odds in the offspring lottery are more than just pure chance. A new study by Harvard University researchers that examines the birthing records of 58,007 women suggests their hunch might be correct. The authors of the study, published in the journal Science Advances last week , found that instead of straight 50/50 odds between boys and girls with each birth, the offspring in families with at least three children tend to follow what scientists call a ""weighted coin toss,"" indicating that each family may have a distinct tendency toward girls or boys. ""We're seeing a lot of us having only boys or girls,"" says Siwen Wang, a doctoral student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the lead author in the study. That led her and colleagues to wonder ""whether it's simply by chance, or is there any underlying biology explaining these sex clustering within families?"" They analyzed data from the second and third iteration of the Nurses' Health Study , which tracked just over 146,000 pregnancies across the U.S. from 1956 to 2015. They found that if the first two children born in a family are girls, the chances of the third child also being a girl are higher than for a boy — and this pattern continues with subsequent children. The same holds true if the first two are boys: The likelihood of having another boy increases, and the trend persists through later births. ""Notably, in families with three boys (MMM), the probability of having another boy was 61%; in families with three girls (FFF), the probability of having another girl was 58%,"" the study authors wrote. Looking for a possible explanation, ""one of the things that stands out is age at first birth — that's associated with a moderately higher chance of having only boys or girls,"" Wang says. ""If you're starting your family younger than 23 ... [there is] around a 40% chance of having a same-sex family,"" she says. If the woman begins having children after age 28, it's around 50% — a relatively small but statistically significant difference. The researchers excluded families with only one child and pregnancies ending in miscarriage, stillbirth or twins. Women with a history of infertility treatments were also left out of the study. To avoid bias from parents who stopped having children after reaching a preferred sex ratio, the researchers did not count each woman's final birth in the analysis. The researchers speculate that in older women, shorter menstrual cycles could factor into the results and that changes in vaginal acidity might favor the survival of sperm carrying either the Y (boys) or X (girls) chromosome. However, they note that because maternal and paternal ages are often correlated, the father's age might also play a role. Since the study included only women, the authors emphasize that the exact mechanism remains uncertain. ""We don't have data about the dad,"" Wang says. ""We don't have data about his genetics or even very precise characteristics ... which is obviously important for sex determination."" It's a concern also raised by Mark Gerstein, a professor at Yale University who wasn't involved in the research. Gerstein specializes in applying computational approaches to molecular biology. ""Given the disparity observed for mothers in the study, one could easily envision an equally impactful relationship with either the genetics or age of the father,"" he says. ""This seems like a promising area for future research to explore."" Ralph Catalano, an emeritus professor of public health at the University of California, Berkeley, who also wasn't involved in the research, thinks that the study's narrow focus on sex at birth may not show the full picture. ""Fewer than 50% of conceptions reach birth. More than 50% are spontaneously aborted [miscarried], and that's not a random draw,"" he says. Due to immunological and developmental sensitivity, females are more likely to be spontaneously aborted early in pregnancy, while males are more vulnerable to spontaneous abortion later in pregnancy because they are physically frailer, he says. ""The sex of infants we see — those who make it to birth — is shaped as much by in utero selection as by sex at conception,"" he says. Another caveat is the composition of the sample. The Nurses' Health Study that the sample was drawn from is made up of overwhelmingly white women residing in the United States. ""Since sex preferences and reproductive behaviors vary across cultures, religions, or countries … the sex ratio distribution pattern observed in our study may not apply to other societies,"" the researchers acknowledge."
1,Science,"Tiny variations in the weather, tides and even the liquid inside the Earth's core can affect the length of the day. NASA hide caption If today feels like it's flying by, you can blame it on our spinning planet: A group of scientists tracking Earth's rotation predicts that the day will be a fraction of a second shorter than normal. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service , which measures the Earth's rotation and forecasts the length of the day, has predicted that July 22 could come out about a millisecond short of a standard 24-hour spin. Variations in the Earth's rotation are not uncommon: On July 9, for example, the Earth's quick spin shortened the day by nearly 1.4 milliseconds. But recent headlines from all over the world have been hyping ""freakishly short"" days in July and August. Scientific experts who constantly monitor the Earth's rotation seem a bit baffled and amused that a few slightly more-speedy-than-normal spins this summer have captured the public's imagination. ""We've known about the rotation of the Earth being variable for about a hundred years,"" says Dennis McCarthy, the former director of time at the U.S. Naval Observatory. ""This is just one of those little variations that comes along."" McCarthy, who's literally written the book on time and Earth's rotation, says the speed of the planet's spin gets influenced by all kinds of factors: the gravitational influence of the moon, the effect of winds and the atmosphere, plus the movements of the Earth's liquid core. Good data on the Earth's rotation goes back thousands of years, thanks to observations of solar eclipses in China. These days, researchers around the world track the spinning of the globe by pointing radio telescopes at quasars, incredibly luminous cores of distant galaxies that are so far away, they act as fixed points in space. That kind of data, plus information from GPS systems, all gets sent to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, which uses it to forecast the day length. Predictions are also made by others, such as the U.S. Naval Observatory. Generally speaking, over millions of years, the Earth's rotation has been slowing down, a trend that's expected to continue into the future, says McCarthy. The main reason is the moon. The moon's gravitational pull on the Earth creates ocean tides, and a process called ""tidal braking"" gradually slows the Earth's spin. ""We know it's slowing down, because we have a real good idea of the effect of the moon,"" says McCarthy. ""Although that slowing down is continuing, there are departures from that general pattern."" Specifically, over the last decade or so, there's been a bumper crop of days that are somewhat short. Last year's shortest day, July 5, 2024, was 1.65 milliseconds shorter than the usual 86,400 seconds, says Thomas Herring , a geophysicist with MIT. He says that was the shortest day since the 1950s, which is when researchers started comparing the rotation of the Earth to the very accurate time standard provided by atomic clocks that measure the regular oscillations of atoms. In the past, the world's timekeepers have occasionally resorted to adding in some ""leap seconds"" — these extra seconds keep atomic time in sync with Earth's rotation as it slows. The last time an extra second was added to the clock was in 2016. The recent speedy spins of the Earth, however, raise the possibility of instituting ""negative leap seconds,"" or basically taking away a second rather than adding one, which is something that's never been done before. ""I think it will be unlikely that a negative leap second will be invoked,"" says Herring, given that regular old leap seconds seem to be falling out of favor. While he and others say that the recent short-duration days are of little significance in and of themselves, understanding and being able to predict the precise rotation of the Earth is important for all kinds of applications—everything from launching missiles to navigation to high-tech farming. At the equator, in one second, the Earth will rotate the length of four football fields, says Nick Stamatakos, head of the Earth orientation department at the U.S. Naval Observatory. ""The Earth's moving pretty fast,"" he says. ""So any little variations will accumulate, and it's an issue."" By looking at the recent rotation history along with information about weather systems and long-term patterns, researchers can make predictions about how the Earth will spin on any given day. These predictions generally get less accurate the farther out they go. While the moon has long been the major player in controlling the speed of the Earth's rotation, one study found that humans are playing a role. Climate change is melting ice at the poles and sending water down to the equator, slowing the rotation down. The researchers believe that this effect is already lengthening the days. Some have calculated that in a worst-case scenario, climate change could eventually redistribute water in a way that would make the days milliseconds longer. That would make humans, rather than the moon, the dominant driver of changes to day length. ""We can really become the dominant drivers of Earth's rotation, due to human-induced climate change,"" says lead researcher Benedikt Soja of ETH Zürich, a university in Switzerland. ""That was really surprising, and really an interesting revelation to us."""

5,Science,"The United States Environmental Protection Agency building is seen in August 2024 in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration is shutting down the agency's unit for scientific research. Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images hide caption The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to shutter the agency's scientific research arm that provides expertise for environmental policies and regulations, as part of the Trump administration's continuing downsizing of the federal government. The agency is closing the Office of Research and Development , which analyzes dangers posed by a variety of hazards, including toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, indoor air contaminants, water pollution, watershed destruction and drinking water pollutants. The office also manages grant programs that fund universities and private companies. ""Under President Trump's leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while powering the great American comeback,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement announcing the plan Friday. ""This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars."" The cut, part of a plan to cut 23% of the EPA's staff, will save $748.8 million, according to the agency. It said the EPA would at the same time add ""laboratory functions and hundreds of scientific, technical, bioinformatic, and information technology experts to EPA's air, water, and chemical offices on top of the thousands of scientists and engineers employed by EPA within those program offices."" In addition, the agency is moving ahead with a plan to create a new ""Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions,"" the EPA says. That new office ""will allow EPA to prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,"" according to the agency.

6,Science,"The California red-legged frog, the largest native frog west of the Rocky Mountains, is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Bradford Hollingsworth/The San Diego Natural History Museum hide caption It had been five years since the first of the frog eggs had been moved, carefully plucked from Mexico's Baja Peninsula and transported by cooler to Southern California. Anny Peralta-Garcia was getting nervous. The eggs belonged to California red-legged frogs, an amphibian that had been eaten, bulldozed and eventually pushed out of the state decades earlier. Peralta-Garcia, an Ensenada-based conservation biologist, had helped harvest fresh eggs from a pond in Baja. The efforts to move them back to the frogs' historic range in California had been monumental — involving private landowners, federal agencies, conservation groups, helicopters and an international border. And now, 87 more moved egg masses later, everyone was waiting to see if it worked. If the re-introduced frogs were breeding. ""We were like, okay, if frogs reach sexual maturity in two years, maybe three, maybe four, we should be seeing something,"" Peralta-Garcia says. ""But then, third year, fourth year, nothing.""

Because of natural attrition and predation, fewer than 1 percent of eggs survive to the tadpole phase, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Jorge Valdez/Fauno del Noroeste hide caption Finally this year, the scientists tried something new to listen in on the frogs: Artificial Intelligence. A customized AI model sifted through thousands of hours of audio recordings from the relocation sites and picked out the sound of mature male frogs calling – grunting more like – at their new location. It was the first time the California red-legged frog had been heard in the wilds of San Diego County in 25 years, and a new egg mass soon followed. It's the latest example of how new technologies like AI are helping muddy-boot biologists and wildlife conservationists fight an ever-worsening extinction crisis . ""It's been like an impossible dream since the 90's to actually be able to go out and see wild frogs at these sites again,"" says Robert Fisher, a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Here's how it happened. The celebrated jumping frog of Calaveras County At about five inches in size, the California red-legged frog is the largest native frog species west of the Rocky Mountains. It used to be found in ponds and waterways, from northern Baja California, in Mexico, to above San Francisco Bay, with populations as far inland as the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The frog's prevalence made it a popular food source in the 1800s and for miners during the California Gold Rush, says Bennett Hardy, an amphibian ecologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum. ""It was kind of the hot cuisine at the time,"" he says. The frog leaped to national fame with Mark Twain's short story The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , which helped launch his writing career. The California red-legged frog used to be prevalent in the wetlands and streams of coastal California and the state's Central Valley before being displaced by invasive species, agriculture and other human development. Paula Sternberg Rodriguez/San Diego Natural History Museum hide caption But the next 150-or-so years weren't so great. Wetlands were drained for agriculture and homes. Streams were dammed, diseases struck and the American bullfrog, a fearsome predator and the largest native frog east of the Rocky Mountains, was introduced. In 1996, the California red-legged frog was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. ""It's now occupying less than 70 percent of its historic range,"" says Susan North, director of stewardship for The Nature Conservancy in California. That includes a stretch from Los Angeles to northern Baja California with zero populations. ""So that's a 260-mile gap in the range of the species,"" she says. ""With a gap that size, you're not going to have five-inch frogs re-colonizing their range naturally."" A group was formed in the mid-2000s, including the Nature Conservancy,, and the decision was made to help bring them back. Genetic testing showed the frogs that used to live in Southern California most closely resembled remnant populations in Mexico. ""So in thinking about reintroducing frogs and bringing them back and restoring these ecosystems, it became clear we needed a Mexican source for the frogs,"" says Fisher. Using coolers, the team of federal wildlife agencies and conservation groups have moved 87 California red-legged frog egg masses to new locations in Southern California. Bradford Hollingsworth/San Diego Natural History Museum hide caption In Mexico, Peralta-Garcia and her nonprofit Fauna del Noroeste set to work preserving the Baja Peninsula's last-remaining populations of red-legged frogs, restoring habitat and boosting their populations with the support of the U.S.-based groups. Meanwhile, in Southern California, two sites with multiple water bodies were identified as suitable habitats in San Diego and Riverside counties. They were cleared of invasive, predatory bullfrogs. In 2020, after a tangle of paperwork and permits, the first translocation took place. ""It was like planes, trains and automobiles,"" Fisher says. ""It was just a lot of different moving parts."" An egg mass was moved by helicopter and car, down dirt roads and over the U.S. border to one of the prepared sites in Southern California. Others followed. The wait began. Tasking AI to listen for frogs The goal of a translocation, or assisted migration, is to either move a species back to a place it's been extirpated from, or to a more suitable habitat. The latter is becoming more relevant as the climate warms and ecosystems change. For a relocation to be successful, the moved species needs to be able to survive on its own in its new environment. It needs to be self-sustaining. And to self-sustain, the frogs needed to be breeding. During mating season, male frogs often call at night to warn other males or attract females. Brad Nissen/USFWS hide caption The easiest way to know if frogs are breeding is by listening for their calls, says Hardy. ""When frogs are calling, most of the time, that's the male of the species using those calls as an advertisement."" But trying to listen out for occasional nocturnal mating calls is tedious work. ""I'd love to be out there every night at these ponds, with my tent and camping and trying to listen for them, but it's just not feasible,"" he says. So instead Hardy and the team set up a series of microphones around the relocation sites. The microphones recorded audio from dusk to dawn, day after day, week after week, collecting thousands of hours of audio during the frog's winter mating season. But that led to a new problem. Hardy says they'd need an army of ears ""to be able to sort through all these files and find where the frogs are."" To help reduce the time and effort, the team partnered with outside engineers to create a custom machine learning model – similar to the popular birding app Merlin – trained to sort through the data and detect the calls of two species: the California red-legged frog and their competitor, the non-native American Bullfrog. Microphones set up around the relocation sites recorded the ""sounds of the night,"" says Bennett Hardy, a researcher at the San Diego Natural History Museum. Bradford Hollingsworth/San Diego Natural History Museum hide caption It wasn't perfect at first. Hardy says that early on, the model flagged a call that it thought was a frog but was in fact a hooded merganser, a bird that's also known as the frog duck because its mating calls sound so similar to a frog's. But with time, they've been able to refine the model and are now working on a real-time alert system that will let biologists know instantaneously when a Bullfrog or red-legged frog is detected. For Clark Winchell, a long-time muddy boot biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the technology has been revelatory. ""I spent countless hours by myself in a kayak listening for bullfrogs. It's not the most efficient use of time,"" he says. ""What they've done with AI on this project is incredible. It's systematic monitoring of two species."" Using the model, earlier this winter, they were able to identify the grunts of a California red-legged frog. Soon after, a survey found a new gelatinous ball of fresh eggs near the microphone that recorded it. North, who'd helped spearhead the effort for more than a decade, says it brought tears to her eyes. There's still work to do, she says. There's still a lot of gaps in the species' historic range. But in some parts of Southern California, for the first time in decades, she says, ""We're hearing them again."""
7,Science,"The Texas Legislature passed a bipartisan law aimed at clarifying the emergency exception to the state's abortion ban this spring. The law is called The Life of the Mother Act. Gabriel C. Pérez/KUT News hide caption AUSTIN, Texas — Across the 18 states that have banned or tightly restricted abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , questions have persisted over when doctors can perform abortions in medical emergencies. State lawmakers out of Texas say a newly passed law called the Life of the Mother Act should clarify for doctors in the state where to draw the line. Reproductive rights advocates and medical groups are watching to see if it saves lives. In Texas , abortion is only permitted when a woman's life or one of her major bodily functions is at risk, but doctors have said it's unclear what qualifies under such emergency medical exceptions. The penalties are steep if they get it wrong: In Texas, doctors face a sentence of up to 99 years in prison, fines and the loss of their medical license. Dr. Emily Briggs is a family physician in Central Texas who says she fields a lot of questions about the ban from young doctors who train at her practice. ""We have physicians in training — medical students and residents — who are choosing not to go through their training in Texas for a multitude of reasons,"" she says. Many new doctors are worried they can't get a full education in Texas because they can't train in abortion care under the ban, Briggs says. Some are concerned about the impact of the ban on their own health as they consider starting families. That's part of why Briggs supported the new law in Texas. ""I think this is a great step in the right direction,"" she says. The new law came after years of activism by doctors and patients, as well as reporting from ProPublica that showed at least three Texas women have died after delays in care. An investigation from the outlet also found that rates of sepsis have risen among pregnant women under the state's abortion ban. A diverse coalition contributed to the writing of the bill, including medical associations and anti-abortion groups. The new clarifications: The bill was filed by Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes , the same lawmaker who authored the Texas Heartbeat Act , a six-week abortion ban that went into effect in 2021, prior to the repeal of Roe v. Wade . ""Most hospitals, most doctors, are getting this right. But this bill is to remove any excuse, remove any question, and also to make sure that doctors are trained,"" Hughes said in March. Amanda Zurawski was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that sought to clarify the emergency medical exception to Texas' abortion ban. She says the state's new law is a ""very, very, very tiny step forward."" Michael Minasi/KUT News hide caption Several states have tried to clarify their emergency exceptions in the past, both through legislative actions and rules released by state medical boards. Some, like Florida , have released lists of medical conditions that would make an abortion lawful. Kentucky passed a law this spring that listed examples of qualifying conditions, including ectopic pregnancy and excessive bleeding. But Briggs says this tactic can be limiting. ""The laundry list approach is not appropriate, because there could be a nuance,"" she says. ""What if her nuanced care is slightly different from what has been deemed appropriate by the legislation?"" Texas' new law does strengthen protections for when a doctor performs an abortion to treat a couple of specific conditions, including ectopic pregnancy and premature rupture of membranes. That's in addition to the provisions about immediacy, burden of proof and discussions among doctors and patients. What the law does not do is add any new exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies — a sticking point for some medical groups and reproductive rights advocates. Some, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said they would oppose any bill that kept Texas' abortion ban in place. Mary Ziegler, a law professor and abortion law expert at the University of California-Davis, says the impact of the new law may depend on how individual doctors read it. ""I think some physicians will take these clarification bills as a kind of reassurance that the state is not just kind of going to go hog wild in prosecuting physicians in emergency cases,"" she says. But Ziegler also predicts that more risk-averse doctors will feel the law doesn't offer enough clarity to offset the steep penalties that still exist. The Life of the Mother Act also requires doctors to receive medical education on the state's abortion laws. While this could be a valuable resource, Ziegler says it could also make doctors feel they are being held to an even higher standard. ""You could see physicians reading this bill and saying, I have to be even more sure this patient is in dire straits to intervene,"" she says. Women who have been affected by Texas' abortion ban are also weighing whether the law can lead to meaningful change, including Amanda Zurawski, who lost part of her reproductive system and nearly died of sepsis when she was denied prompt abortion care. She became the lead plaintiff in the high-profile Zurawski v. Texas lawsuit , which asked the courts the clarify the state's abortion ban. The court ultimately ruled it's not its role to clarify state laws. Zurawski says she sees Texas' new law as ""a very, very, very tiny step forward,"" but that the legislation ultimately does not make her feel safer. ""I can't get pregnant again, because of what the state of Texas made me go through. If I could, I would not remain in Texas for a pregnancy. There's no way,"" she says. Ziegler says it will take time to determine whether the law will prevent more cases like Zurawski's, as doctors and hospital administrators learn about the legislation and are faced with real-time medical emergencies. ""There's a kind of rubber meets the road question about whether these actually prevent tragedies or not,"" Ziegler says, ""and I think it's too early to say."""
8,Science,"Orango National Park on the Bijagós Archipelago off of the coast of Guinea-Bissau is a newly designated World Heritage Site. Hellio & van Ingen/IBAP/UNESCO Nomination File hide caption Twenty-six sites have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List , designating their cultural and natural importance. Locations this year include a sacred mountain in Malawi; petroglyphs in South Korea; remains of a port and forts from 17th century Port Royal, Jamaica; a king's palaces in Germany; and a river canyon in Brazil noted for its biodiversity. The World Heritage List, now numbering 1,248 locations , includes ""cultural and natural properties of outstanding universal value."" Sites have been added almost every year since 1978. UNESCO is a United Nations agency focused on culture, science and education. Representatives of 21 countries on the World Heritage Committee met this month in Paris to finalize which locations to add to the list. Countries with World Heritage sites must commit to preserving them; countries with designated sites could also receive funding to help with that conservation. Here's a selection of some of the locations added this year: Neuschwanstein Castle is part of the four palace complexes included in the World Heritage Site list. J. Beck/UNESCO Nomination File hide caption King Ludwig II of Bavaria had these grand palaces built between 1864 and 1886 in what is now Germany, according to UNESCO . He ascended to the throne at age 18 and has been called the "" Mad King ,"" because of his long rants, hallucinations and paranoia. The four palace complexes listed are called Neuschwanstein, Linderhof, Schachen and Herrenchiemsee. The palaces are now a tourist attraction , ""records in stone of the ideal fantasy world which the king built as a refuge from reality,"" according to a biography on a website for the palaces .

The dynasty lasted from 1038 to 1227, when it was destroyed by Genghis Khan's Mongol army . China's government said the site shows ""the crucial role of Xixia as a key distribution center on the Silk Roads during the 11th and 13th centuries."" It added that the location is ""the largest, highest-ranked, and most intact archaeological site from the Xixia period that has survived to the present day.""

9,Science,"How do scientists monitor the population and mating habits of the threatened California red-legged frog? With careful listening—and a little help from AI. Paula Sternberg Rodriguez/San Diego Natural History Museum hide caption How do scientists monitor the population and mating habits of the threatened California red-legged frog? With careful listening—and a little help from AI. If you were a miner in California during the Gold Rush, you might have dined on a California red-legged frog. The largest native frog in the western United States, this Golden State denizen used to be found as far inland as the Sierra Nevada mountains and south, into Baja California. But overharvesting, predation by invasive bullfrogs and habitat loss took their toll on the frogs: Today, they're listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Over the past five years, a team of conservationists carefully translocated a population of these red-legged frogs, moving them from northwestern Mexico to two sites in California. Once they got there, though, they were stuck with another problem: how to monitor that population's growth. Luckily, the California red-legged frog has a distinctive mating call that scientists can look out for. It's low-pitched and creaky, like the noise you get when you rub your finger on a balloon. But listening for them every night — and picking those calls out of the turkey calls and coyote howls and car horns of a night in Southern California — is a huge task, even for the most enthusiastic amphibian expert. That's where AI comes in. Scientists can use special machine learning models to sort through thousands of hours of recordings, identifying the places where California red-legged frogs were heard and surveying their success. It's saving the conservation team time and money, so that they can focus on translocating more frogs in the future. Want to hear more stories about critters or conservation?

10,Science,"Researchers set out to find the clues behind this cucumbers seed dispersal superpower. Stanislav Gorb/Helen Gorges hide caption Three summers ago, Kiel University biomechanist Stainslav Gorb , returned to Germany after a vacation in Turkey with a present for Ph.D. student Helen Gorges . ""He came back and was like, 'Helen, I brought you something. They might explode, but maybe you can work on them,'"" she recalls. He presented her with a handful of squirting cucumbers, a smaller, hairier cousin of what one would find in the produce aisle — except that it's toxic. But what the squirting cucumber lacks in palatability, it makes up for in a feat of ballistic seed dispersal. When the fruit is ripe, it's puffed up with fluid, pressurized, and ready to burst. The merest disturbance or nudge causes the cucumber to pop open and expel its seeds in a fraction of a second, sending seeds on a germination journey that can reach some distance away, reducing competition with their parent. Once Gorges learned about this botanical feat, she was hooked. ""We just wanted to know how the whole explosion works,"" says Gorges. She and her colleagues have done just that in a talk she gave at last week's Society for Experimental Biology conference in Belgium and an upcoming publication in the journal npj Science of Plants . ""The plant is crazy,"" summarizes Gorges. ""The fruit really prepares for perfect dispersal — as far as possible so that the plant will grow everywhere."" Gorges and her colleagues started figuring out how the cucumber worked by taking a few hundred photos of the plants — some from Turkey and others from the local botanical garden in Kiel in northern Germany — to measure the angle between the stem and the ripened fruit. It was consistently a touch more than 50 degrees. ""With air resistance,"" she says, ""it just is the perfect angle so that they can shoot as far as they can — the perfect ballistic angle for the perfect shooting parabola."" Next, Gorges examined the fifty-some seeds inside the fruit. But cut one open, and the whole thing explodes. So she took micro-CT scans of the fruit's interior, which revealed the seeds lined up in rows, awaiting their launch, round end first. ""The seeds, they really all come out in the same direction,"" says Gorges. To examine the expulsion of the seeds in greater detail, she used high speed videography. When Gorges later slowed down the video, she observed the stem lifting off and a jet of fluid spurting out, accompanied by one seed shooting out at a time. She calculated that the seeds can reach velocities of up to nearly 30 miles an hour and they can launch themselves almost 40 feet. The results are consistent with a study published in 2024 in the journal PNAS by a different team in England that calculated an average launch angle of about 43 degrees, velocities of 37 miles per hour, and launch distances of almost 40 feet. ""It's actually very difficult to throw a small object a large distance,"" says Dwight Whitaker , a physicist at Pomona College who didn't contribute to either research project. ""To my knowledge, [this is] one of the few plants, if not the only plant, that uses a fluid to eject its seeds — this pressurized fluid that sort of pushes them and accelerates them as they come out."" Gorges then examined the seeds' slimy coat. When she placed a seed on a glass slide and let it dry, she found its adhesive quality was so strong that a single seed could support as much as a six-pound weight. ""If adhesion is what it's all about,"" says Sheila Patek , a biologist at Duke University who wasn't involved in the research, ""then in fact, the remarkable launch velocities may have more to do with making sure that when that seed hits something, it sticks"" — so that it might then be carried farther by whatever it's stuck to. To test this idea, future work could consider how well the seeds adhere to various surfaces when launched at different speeds. Patek says that the discoveries about the squirting cucumber may well have many applications. ""These types of materials are really translatable in today's world of material science,"" she says, including soft robotics that might disperse seeds on farms or deliver drugs in the human body. And these seeds, whose stickiness changes when wet, could help inspire materials designed to work differently in damp or dry conditions. Not bad for a little squirt."
11,Science,"Mitochondria, like the one seen in cutaway view, are the powerhouses inside cells. ARTUR PLAWGO/Getty Images/Science Photo Library hide caption Scientists can protect children from being born with certain devastating genetic disorders by creating ""three-parent"" babies, according to the results of a landmark study released Wednesday. British researchers used the experimental technique to help families have eight children who appear healthy. They now range in age from younger than 6 months to older than 2 years. The families have been plagued for generations by rare but often fatal inherited mitochondrial disorders , according to two papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The four boys and four girls, including a set of identical twins, need to be followed longer to confirm the procedure is safe and effective, the researchers say. But the results are being hailed as a milestone in the quest to harness cutting-edge genetic technologies to enable more women to have healthy babies. ""Mitochondrial disease can be devastating for the family. It can be tragic,"" says Doug Turnbull , a professor of neurology who is part of the team at Newcastle University that has been developing the technique for more than a decade. ""This is an important breakthrough — a big step forward."" The research is thrilling many families, doctors and other scientists. ""I think this is a landmark advance. It is pioneering work,"" says Dietrich Egli , an associate professor of developmental cell biology at Columbia University who had been advocating for lifting federal restrictions on similar research in the U.S. ""It is extraordinary — no question about it."" But some critics question the approach. They worry about risks, and whether the approach will open the door to using genetic technologies to manipulate the genes in other ways to someday create ""designer babies."" Moreover, genetic changes like this can be passed down for generations. So any mistakes could introduce deleterious mutations into the human gene pool, they say. ""It's dangerous,"" says Stuart Newman , a professor of cell biology and anatomy at the New York Medical College. ""It's biologically dangerous. And then it's dangerous culturally because it's the beginning of biological manipulation that won't just end with preventing certain diseases, but will blossom into a full-fledged eugenics program where genes will be manipulated to make designer babies."" Current U.S. regulations would prevent the procedure from being used in this country to produce children. But a New York doctor reported in 2016 that he had created a three-parent baby for a Jordanian family in Mexico . Australia has legalized i t. And doctors in some other countries, including Greece and Ukraine , have used the technique to try to help infertile women have babies, even though it's unclear the method works for that purpose. ""I think it will normalize the fact that it's appropriate to take this material and to tinker with it, all in the pursuit of the perfect baby, whatever somebody happens to think that is,"" says Francois Baylis , a distinguished research professor emerita at Dalhousie University in Canada. Mitochondrial disorders can cause serious health problems, including paralysis, heart failure, brain damage, strokes and blindness. Children born with one of these disorders often live short, painful lives. The disorders are caused by defects in mitochondrial DNA. The genetic material is the blueprint for structures called mitochondria, which provide energy to cells. This DNA is passed only from mother to child. The fix tested by the British scientists is sometimes called "" mitochondrial donation ."" It involves removing the genes from the nucleus of the fertilized egg of a couple who wants to have a healthy baby. Those genes represent the majority of genetic material in eggs and are responsible for most of a person's traits, such as their appearance. The defective mitochondrial DNA is left behind. The genes from the nucleus of the egg are then injected into a fertilized egg from a healthy woman that has had all of its DNA removed except for the donor's healthy mitochondrial DNA. This is called pronuclear transfer. The resulting embryo can then develop with the healthy donor mitochondria and later be implanted into the womb of the woman who wants a healthy, genetically related baby. As a result, the baby has all the DNA responsible for the main traits of the two parents trying to have a healthy baby along with a small amount of mitochondrial DNA from the woman who donated the egg. That is why they are sometimes referred to as ""three-parent"" babies. In the new study, the babies were born to seven women at high risk of transmitting serious, disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations to their offspring. Their mother's disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations were either undetectable or present at levels that are unlikely to cause disease, the researchers reported. ""A child with one of these conditions can be in a lot of pain, suffer all sorts of problems and die. It's truly horrible to have to watch your child slowly die of something that bad. It's heartbreaking,"" says Robin Lovell-Badge , a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London who wrote an editorial accompanying the papers. ""So for women at risk of having children with serious mitochondrial diseases, this provides them with an option to have children without suffering. It's very encouraging."" ""All the children are well and continue to meet their developmental milestones,"" Newcastle University's Turnbull says. Baylis, at Dalhousie University, and others worry about risks that may not yet be apparent, to the babies themselves, the women having the babies and the women donating the eggs, such as a dangerous hyperstimulation of their ovaries. ""There are risks to the women who are going to be receiving the embryo and there are risks to the women who are the donor of the eggs that will be providing the mitochondria, Baylis says. ""We don't know the future."" She's also worried about putting so much importance on the need by couples to only have children with their own genes. ""What you're seeing is this sense that, 'My genes are very valuable. My genes are the only ones worth reproducing.' And I think that's always worth questioning,"" Baylis says. Women at risk of having children with a mitochondrial disorder have other options, including adoption, she argues. Turnbull acknowledges the research remains at a relatively early stage, requiring additional follow-up research and monitoring. ""The results so far are very encouraging,"" he says. Turnbull argues reproductive technologies are highly regulated in Britain and many other countries: ""I think there are enough checks and balances in the system to prevent this from becoming a slippery slope to designer babies."" Others stress that the technology is distinct from gene-editing techniques like CRISPR, which have also raised fears about designer babies. ""This is totally different,"" Lovell-Badge says. ""This is using a method that is avoiding a serious disease. If you care about peoples' health, peoples' desire to have genetically related children, then I see no reason why you should not accept these methods."""
12,Science,"Even healthy brains slow down as they age. But there are ways to keep that thinker in tip-top shape. OsakaWayne Studios/Getty Images hide caption After about age 40, our brains begin to lose a step or two. Each year, our reaction time slows by a few thousandths of a second. We're also less able to recall items on a shopping list. Those changes can be signs of a disease, like Alzheimer's. But usually, they're not. ""Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people,"" says Matt Huentelman , a professor at TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in Phoenix. Huentelman should know. He helps run MindCrowd , a free online cognitive test that has been taken by more than 700,000 adults. About a thousand of those people had test scores indicating that their brain was ""exceptional,"" meaning they performed like a person 30 years younger on tests of memory and processing speed. Genetics played a role, of course. But Huentelman and a team of researchers have been focusing on other differences. ""We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing,"" he says. Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Other measures include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting plenty of exercise. Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the McKnight Brain Research Foundation , which funds studies on age-related cognitive decline and memory loss. To preserve cognitive function in later life, ""we're going to have to understand [brain] aging at a mechanistic level,"" says Alice Luo Clayton , a neuroscientist who is the group's chief executive officer. Another speaker was Christian Agudelo , a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami's Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute. ""I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids,"" Agudelo says. Those kids are 4 and 6 now, so Agudelo is getting more sleep. But his own experience is consistent with his research on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline. ""The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be both structurally and functionally,"" Agudelo says. Keep in mind: Better sleep isn't just about getting more sleep. The key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the sleep stages , Agudelo says. Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brain wave patterns. But people usually know when they've had a good night's rest, Agudelo says. ""You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile,"" he says. ""You feel refreshed."" Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky. But people can improve the odds with certain behaviors, Agudelo says ""Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun"" can lead to better sleep, he says. So can ""being active, both socially and physically."" Those behaviors increase ""sleep pressure,"" the body's natural desire to sleep the longer we are awake, Agudelo says. When that pressure is high, he says, ""we can fall asleep more easily and deeply."" Brain aging is also influenced by vascular risk factors, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes, says Charles DeCarli , a neurologist who co-directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Davis. People know that these risk factors usually contribute to medical conditions like heart attack or stroke, DeCarli says. But research on thousands of people 65 and older has found that these risk factors can also impact the brain directly — even if they don't cause a heart attack or other cardiovascular problems. ""The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than in people who do not have them,"" he says.

14,Science,"The dam on the Guadalupe River that forms Nimitz Lake, the city of Kerrville's primary water reservoir. County commissioners say they have a plan to drain at least one of the artificial reservoirs along the river, to facilitate the search for human remains and hazardous debris following the flash flood of July 4. Martin Kaste hide caption Authorities in Kerr County say they have plans to drain at least one flood-swollen lake, as they continue to search for the roughly 100 people still thought to be missing after the catastrophic flash flooding of July 4 . The dammed reservoirs along the Guadalupe River near Kerrville are believed to have captured debris washed downstream. One local resident, Ann Carr, told county commissioners on Monday about what she and her sister saw happening on Ingram Lake, just upstream from Kerrville, on the night of the flood. ""We went out and started seeing the lake rise, and as we did we saw all kinds of things float past. Propane tanks, kitchen appliances — you name it!"" she told commissioners. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said in a Monday morning meeting of the county commissioners that authorities were aware of the potentially hazardous debris in the lakes. There's also a possibility some of the missing may be buried in debris in the riverbeds or in the lakes. ""We don't know how many we've lost,"" Kelly said. ""We've heard accounts of trailer after trailer after trailer being swept into the river with families in them. Can't find the trailers."" Kelly said the search now includes dive teams and sonar. They've found indications that the flood waters may have buried large objects. He cited the example of a trailer found stuck in gravel under 27 feet of water. Commissioners said they have a plan to drain at least one of the lakes on the Guadalupe, but they're not ready to share details. The effort may prove to be expensive and complex, in part because of the presence of endangered species in that part of the river. At a makeshift memorial erected near the dam that formed Nimitz Lake, Kerrville's main reservoir for drinking water, local resident Dwight McDonald says he sees no alternative to draining it. ""We're going to have to,"" he says. ""It's a huge task, but nobody's going to stop until we get the last one,"" he says, referring to the missing people. ""Texas is different — this is family down here."""
15,Science,"Rescuers carry a boat into the subway in Zhengzhou, China, in July after flash floods trapped passengers underground. STR/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Rescuers carry a boat into the subway in Zhengzhou, China, in July after flash floods trapped passengers underground. Global warming is driving dangerous and disruptive flooding in underground rail systems around the world. Flooded tunnels and stations have disrupted service and stranded passengers in Boston, London, San Francisco, Taipei, Bangkok, Washington, D.C., and a host of other cities in recent years. But the problem has taken on added urgency this summer, with multiple, high-profile subway floods driven by summer rainstorms. Overnight, the remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded much of the New York City subway. Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a travel ban and warned residents to ""stay off subways"" as up to 10 inches of rain fell in some parts of the region in a matter of hours. It is the third time New York's subways have flooded this summer and the first time the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency warning for the city. Heavy rain has also repeatedly swamped underground tracks in Boston . Our infrastructure is not ready for climate change, a thread from tonight. 28th St. subway station pic.twitter.com/uYemJKB8yg Elsewhere, subway floods have turned deadly. In July, 13 passengers died in Zhengzhou, China, after flash floods trapped them. Harrowing videos showed people struggling to breathe a shrinking pocket of air as the water rose. ""None of us had seen people with water up to their necks, standing in underground trains,"" says Slobodan Djordjevic, an engineer at the University of Exeter who specializes in flooding of underground train systems. Djordjevic has spent much of his career studying floods in subway tunnels. But he says what he saw happening in China shocked him. ""I actually considered whether this was even real."" In China and around the world, the culprit is climate-driven torrential rain. Zhengzhou received about a year's worth of precipitation in just one day. Earlier this summer, the remnants of a tropical storm dumped a month's worth of rain on New York City in the span of an afternoon. Dozens of subway systems around the world have experienced flooding, Djordjevic says, and he estimates it's likely hundreds of thousands of passengers have been directly affected. That has created tension between the need to provide reliable, low-emissions mass transit options and the growing cost of maintaining underground transit in a wetter world. Keeping water out of tunnels and stations is expensive, especially in places with aging, leaky subways built for a 20th century climate. Some help could come from the federal government. The infrastructure bill moving through Congress allocates $66 billion for rail — a huge infusion of cash that could help fund retrofitting of old subway systems to keep water out and the building of new train lines in places that currently depend on cars. ""Every city should have a comprehensive review of flood risk for the underground system,"" Djordjevic says. ""Looking ahead, authorities need to think very carefully about where they want to build new lines, new stations, new tunnels."" Many U.S. cities are a decade or more into adapting their subway systems to a wetter climate. In Boston , the transit authority has started waterproofing stations and protecting tracks that are vulnerable to sea level rise. After Hurricane Sandy flooded miles of subway tunnels, New York poured millions of dollars into flood control for the nation's largest underground rail system. In Washington, the transit authority has spent millions of dollars waterproofing leaky tunnels and plans to spend even more to keep water out of vents and station entrances. ""We are investing more in water mitigation today than we ever have,"" says Andy Off, executive vice president of capital delivery for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The authority also has an emergency flood response. A unit tracks inclement weather so that flooding hot spots can be monitored and workers can put out sandbags and check underground pump stations before the water arrives. But keeping the water out is a constant battle. Much of Washington metro system was built nearly 50 years ago, and the subways in New York and Boston are even older. Air vents are flush with the sidewalk or street, which makes it easy for water to flow in. Many station entrances are in low-lying places or are constructed in ways that funnel water from the street down stairs or escalators. ""Older systems were designed for the climate of the past,"" says Tina Hodges, a former analyst at the Federal Transit Administration who wrote a 2011 report about climate risks to public transit in the United States. ""In the Northeastern United States, which is home to some of the oldest and largest transit systems in the country, there's already been a 67% increase in the heaviest precipitation."" The same is true in many European cities, including London and Berlin. In recent years, passengers have captured strikingly similar videos of water cascading into subway stations in cities thousands of miles apart. Newer subway systems in flood-prone parts of Asia may offer clues about how to adapt. As this summer's disaster in Zhengzhou made clear, Asian cities are on the front lines of climate-driven subway flooding. And the fact that those newer systems are often better protected from flooding and fatalities underscores the urgency of adaptation. Water runs down the steps of a subway station in Berlin in 2019. Cities in the U.S. and Europe are racing to waterproof older subway systems as climate change drives more rain. Fabian Fuchs/picture alliance via Getty Images hide caption ""There's a lot to learn from Asian cities, ways to deal with flooding of underground trains,"" Djordjevic says. For example, in Taipei, where flooding from cyclones is common, Taiwanese authorities raised the entrances to stations to keep water out. In Kyoto, Japan, researchers built a full-scale model of a subway station escalator and simulated a flash flood to see how much water people could safely walk through and to help create emergency plans for closing stations during storms. Bangkok has long had a flood warning system to keep passengers safe, although the city has struggled to prevent underground train flooding. Many subway systems in Asia were also built more recently than their counterparts in the U.S. and Europe, so they are better-suited to the current climate, Djordjevic says. In the U.S., larger cities are generally doing a better job adapting to and preparing for transit flooding than smaller ones because they have more resources, Hodges says. For example, large transit departments increasingly employ resilience experts who work full time on adaptation and can also collaborate with climate scientists and engineers to come up with solutions that protect trains and passengers from flooding. Smaller cities are less likely to have such resources. ""There are definitely barriers to adapting to climate change, one of which is that it's just difficult to interpret the information that comes in from climate scientists into actionable information that planners and engineers can use,"" Hodges says. Commuters head into New York's Third Avenue-149th Street subway station on Thursday. Heavy rain from remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded much of the city's subway system. Authorities issued a travel ban and warned residents to avoid stations. David Dee Delgado/Getty Images hide caption Commuters head into New York's Third Avenue-149th Street subway station on Thursday. Heavy rain from remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded much of the city's subway system. Authorities issued a travel ban and warned residents to avoid stations. The benefits of underground trains still outweigh the costs for many cities. Since Hurricane Sandy, New York has pressed forward with subway line expansions. San Francisco is expanding its subway, even as the system faces flooding from sea level rise. Fort Lauderdale, Fla., one of the most flood-prone places in the country, is considering a new underground train line that would reduce car traffic and allow residents to commute into the downtown area by train. Investing in new underground infrastructure in a city known as the ""Venice of America"" has raised some eyebrows. The editorial board of the city's paper spoke out against the plan and argued that the train should cross a major river in the city via a bridge, rather than a tunnel. But while Mayor Dean Trantalis acknowledges that climate-driven flooding is a worry in his city, he dismisses concerns about train tunnel flooding. ""If you put in the proper pump stations and the proper technology to anticipate heavy rainfalls and things like that — I've lived in Fort Lauderdale for almost 40 years, and I've never once seen our tunnel flooded,"" he says. And keeping the train underground will alleviate traffic congestion caused by railroad crossings, Trantalis says. Experts say it's important that new infrastructure take into account the costs of maintenance and the climate of the future. Sea level rise is accelerating in many places, including Florida. If new train systems are designed to last 30 years or more, they will need to withstand dramatically higher tides as well as more frequent and severe storms. ""When it comes to coastal areas or parts of Florida, sooner or later sea level rise will lead to some areas that need to be abandoned or protected at a very, very high cost,"" Djordjevic says. ""So those decisions would need to be looked at very carefully."""
16,Science,"A view along the Kennet and Avon Canal near Newbury Lock, Newbury, Berkshire, England. Andy Soloman/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images hide caption MARLBOROUGH, England — After years of illegal polluting by Britain's water industry, an independent report planned for release in the coming days could lead to tightened regulation while also prompting an expensive modernization drive. The report, led by a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Jon Cunliffe, was commissioned by Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government last year, after at least a decade of calls from environmental activists who have demanded an end to illegal polluting of the United Kingdom's waterways. The rivers in England's ""green and pleasant land,"" to quote a famous hymn , have in recent years often run brown and dirty due to widespread and frequent sewage discharges by some of the nation's largest private water companies. That was visible on a recent visit to the tranquil banks of the River Kennet near a historical rural market town called Marlborough, in the county of Wiltshire, about two hours west of London. Humans have lived in the fertile valley of the River Kennet for thousands of years, and today, so does James Wallace, the chief executive of the advocacy group River Action . After making his way through some leafy undergrowth to what he says was once a cherished family swimming spot on the Kennet, he pauses as a flock of ducks flies low overhead. ""It is beautiful,"" Wallace says, as he nears the river's muddy banks. ""But as we step towards the water edge, we can see this carpet going along the bottom of algae, which is snuffing out the opportunity for life."" In the minutes he stood there speaking, there was no sign of any fish in a river long known for its brown and rainbow trout, something Wallace attributed to a single cause. ""On the surface, we see a vibrant, healthy habitat, and beneath we see a dead one, and that is because of sewage pollution,"" he said. Wallace says protected natural environments, like the Kennet, are being ""trashed by corporate profits."" He points out a sewage treatment plant several miles upriver. It is operated by Thames Water, Britain's largest private water company, which has become nationally notorious for its untreated sewage discharges, mounting debts and substantial dividend payouts. A van belonging to Thames Water, a British private utility company that handles water supply and waste water treatment, sits outside Mogden Sewage Treatment Works, in west London, June 4. Toby Melville/Reuters hide caption In May, Thames Water was fined more than $165 million by Britain's water regulator, known as Ofwat, for discharging untreated sewage into rivers without sufficient explanation. It was separately fined for paying hefty but unjustified dividends to its shareholders. Reacting to the verdict, the company said in a statement : ""We take our responsibility towards the environment very seriously and note that Ofwat acknowledges we have already made progress to address issues raised in the investigation relating to storm overflows."" Behind a green metal gate, the facility in Marlborough, like many elsewhere in Britain, today has to service a larger population and changing rainfall patterns thanks to climate change, Wallace acknowledges. But he says spending to upgrade infrastructure or build new facilities like this has failed to keep pace with those changing requirements. ""The system was designed to cope with it years ago, but not now, because of a lack of investment across the industry ... the whole of Britain is exposed to a serious crisis in water pollution,"" he says. That crisis is systemic, experts warn, and the stench of sewage in popular swimming spots has repeatedly ignited public outrage, prompting political recriminations while also casting a harsh spotlight on the nation's regulatory system. Several high-profile incidents have helped underline that Britain's Victorian-era water system, privatized by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the late 1980s, is largely struggling to serve the population of modern Britain. Ofwat, the water regulator, has historically prioritized low bills since privatization, according to Bertie Wnek, an infrastructure expert at Public First , a British policy consultancy. That prevented private businesses with local water monopolies from expanding their revenues by unilaterally raising prices. As a consequence, Wnek says, companies were instead encouraged to borrow heavily in order to invest in any new infrastructure, or to generate any substantial profits. ""What we have is a situation where companies have been kind of incentivized to bring on a load of debt onto the system over time,"" Wnek says. ""We're sort of paying the price for that behavior."" Hugo Tagholm, U.K. executive director of the nonprofit Oceana , calls this behavior a ""financial scandal,"" and criticizes companies like Thames Water for extracting tens of billions from the industry, while failing to invest sufficiently in their water pipes and treatment works. ""This is something that's enraged the public,"" says Tagholm, a sea swimmer and surfer who once led a high-profile campaign group called Surfers against Sewage . ""The system needs massive investment, and that really should come from shareholders, rather than the customer."" But water companies and their representatives say there are no simple solutions to this complex problem. Ashley Book, head of waste operations at Mogden Catchment, walks between aeration lanes used to process sewage water from over 2 million people, at Mogden Sewage Treatment Works, operated by Thames Water, in west London, June 4. Toby Melville/Reuters hide caption Some hope Cunliffe's report will address long-standing complaints about unequal regulatory measures, and restrictions on pricing that have hindered the construction of expensive new water infrastructure. ""The way to get investment is through clear regulation, strong steers from governments and a system that brings in the finance and the investment projects that upgrade those networks and increase our supply,"" says Jeevan Jones, chief economist at Water UK , the water industry's main British trade group. ""The water industry's been really, really clear that what this sector needs is investment, and that investment will unlock upgrades."" Cunliffe's review is expected to propose several comprehensive changes that would focus on strategic planning, legislative reform, regulatory oversight, and reducing the debt loads on existing water infrastructure and assets. But based on his interim findings, published earlier in the summer, Cunliffe seems unlikely to advocate a renationalization of the industry, as Starmer's Labour government is pursuing with Britain's railways, for instance. One potential change could lead to a more supervisory style of regulation, where Ofwat or its equivalent focuses more on the specific challenges individual water companies are facing — aging pipes, say, or not enough reservoirs — rather than just a form of benchmarking that makes little sense in a nation where each region — and thus private water monopoly — faces different water-related challenges. Bhikhu Samat, a legal director specializing in water regulations at the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, believes such a reset should have taken place earlier, and that longer-term investors — like pension funds, rather than the private equity firms and commercial banks that have grown increasingly prevalent in Britain's water industry — would help build longer-term financial resilience too. ""It's really a great way for us as a nation to look at what our goals are with water scarcity and climate change impacting us hugely,"" Samat says of Cunliffe's forthcoming report on the industry. ""The reset is well overdue, and fundamentally, when the final report comes out, one hopes that the recommendations will be implemented wholesale."""
17,Science,"A research project run by the Department of Veterans Affairs that analyzes genetic data has led to medical breakthroughs.  Yet critical steps to keep the research going are stalled out. Billy Schuerman/Virginian Pilot/Tribune News Service/Getty Images hide caption One of the world's biggest genetic databases comprises DNA data donated over the years by more than a million retired military service members. It's part of a project run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The initiative, dubbed the Million Veteran Program, is a ""crown jewel of the country,"" said David Shulkin, a physician who served as VA secretary during the first Trump administration. Data from the project has contributed to research on the genetics of anxiety and peripheral artery disease, for instance, and has resulted in hundreds of published papers. Researchers say the repository has the potential to help answer health questions not only specific to veterans — like who is most vulnerable to post-service mental health issues, or why they seem more prone to cancer — but also relevant to the nation as a whole. ""When the VA does research, it helps veterans, but it helps all Americans,"" Shulkin said in an interview. Researchers now say they fear the program is in limbo, jeopardizing the years of work it took to gather the veterans' genetic data and other information, like surveys and blood samples. ""There's sort of this cone of silence,"" said Amy Justice, a Yale epidemiologist with a VA appointment as a staff physician. ""We've got to make sure this survives."" Genetic data is enormously complex, and analyzing it requires vast computing power that VA doesn't possess. Instead, it has relied on a partnership with the Energy Department, which provides its supercomputers for research purposes. In late April, VA Secretary Doug Collins disclosed to Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, that agreements authorizing use of the computers for the genomics project remained unsigned, with some expiring in September, according to materials shared with KFF Health News by congressional Democrats. Spokespeople for the two agencies did not reply to multiple requests for comment. Other current and former employees within the agencies — who asked not to be identified, for fear of reprisal from the Trump administration — said they don't know whether the critical agreements will be renewed. One researcher called computing ""a key ingredient"" to major advances in health research, such as the discovery of new drugs. The agreement with the Energy Department ""should be extended for the next 10 years,"" the researcher said. The uncertainty has caused ""incremental"" damage, Justice said, pointing to some Million Veteran Program grants that have lapsed. As the year progresses, she predicted, ""people are going to be feeling it a lot."" Because of their military experience, maintaining veterans' health poses different challenges compared with caring for civilians. The program's examinations of genetic and clinical data allow researchers to investigate questions that have bedeviled veterans for years. As examples, Shulkin cited ""how we might be able to better diagnose earlier and start thinking about effective treatments for these toxic exposures"" — such as to burn pits used to dispose of trash at military outposts overseas — as well as predispositions to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""The rest of the research community isn't likely to focus specifically"" on veterans, he said. The VA community, however, has delivered discoveries of importance to the world: Three VA researchers have won Nobel Prizes, and the agency created the first pacemaker. Its efforts also helped ignite the boom in GLP-1 weight loss drugs. Yet turbulence has been felt throughout VA's research enterprise. Like other government scientific agencies, it's been buffeted by layoffs, contract cuts, and canceled research. ""There are planned trials that have not started, there are ongoing trials that have been stopped, and there are trials that have fallen apart due to staff layoffs — yes or no?"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressing Collins in a May hearing of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. The agency, which has a budget of roughly $1 billion for its research arm this fiscal year, has slashed infrastructure that supports scientific inquiry, according to documents shared with KFF Health News by Senate Democrats on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It has canceled at least 37 research-related contracts, including for genomic sequencing and for library and biostatistics services. The department has separately canceled four contracts for cancer registries for veterans, creating potential gaps in the nation's statistics. Job worries also consume many scientists at the VA. According to agency estimates in May, about 4,000 of its workers are on term limits, with contracts that expire after certain periods. Many of these individuals worked not only for the VA's research groups but also with clinical teams or local medical centers. When the new leaders first entered the agency, they instituted a hiring freeze, current and former VA researchers told KFF Health News. That prevented the agency's research offices from renewing contracts for their scientists and support staff, which in previous years had frequently been a pro forma step. Some of those individuals who had been around for decades haven't been rehired, one former researcher told KFF Health News. The freeze and the uncertainty around it led to people simply departing the agency, a current VA researcher said. The losses, the individual said, include some people who ""had years of experience and expertise that can't be replaced."" Preserving jobs — or some jobs — has been a congressional focus. In May, after inquiries from Sen. Jerry Moran, the Republican who chairs the Veterans' Affairs Committee, about staffing for agency research and the Million Veteran Program, Collins wrote in a letter that he was extending the terms of research employees for 90 days and developing exemptions to the hiring freeze for the genomics project and other research initiatives. Holding jobs is one thing — doing them is another. In June, at the annual research meeting of AcademyHealth — an organization of researchers, policymakers, and others who study how U.S. health care is delivered — some VA researchers were unable to deliver a presentation touching on psychedelics and mental health disparities and another on discrimination against LGBTQ+ patients, Aaron Carroll, the organization's president, told KFF Health News. At that conference, reflecting a trend across the federal government, researchers from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality also dropped out of presenting. ""This drop in federal participation is deeply concerning, not only for our community of researchers and practitioners but for the public, who rely on transparency, collaboration, and evidence-based policy grounded in rigorous science,"" Carroll said. KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF ."

19,Science,"A view of high-voltage transmission towers in Houston. The law President Trump signed on July 4 ends tax incentives for wind and solar projects and is expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., according to a nonpartisan think tank. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption The law that President Trump signed on July 4 ending tax incentives for wind and solar projects is expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with some of the sharpest increases in Republican-led states, according to Energy Innovation , a nonpartisan think tank. Without tax credits, the cost of wind and solar plants will go up. Companies are likely to respond by building fewer of those projects, and those facilities that do come online will have bigger price tags, according to multiple estimates. As that happens, the country is expected to generate more electricity from natural gas plants, which are often more expensive to run than wind and solar projects. That shift will hit hardest in states that don't have their own policies to drive renewable energy development , says Dan O'Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation. In Oklahoma , for example, homeowners, renters and businesses are likely to see electricity rates shoot up by between 60% and 350% over the next decade, according to Energy Innovation. The firm expects rates to rise by at least 48% in Kentucky , 39% in Missouri and 30% in Kansas . The congressional delegations of those states are overwhelmingly Republican . ""In a world before the bill, you would have a lot of cheap renewables"" built regardless of state policies, O'Brien says. ""But after the bill, there's nothing making sure those keep coming on, so you're seeing a lot more expensive gas generation."" A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that Trump has taken steps to boost U.S. energy production. ""The One, Big, Beautiful Bill will turbocharge energy production by streamlining operations for maximum efficiency and expanding domestic production capacity, which will deliver further relief to American families and businesses,"" Rogers said. At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump called wind and solar energy ""a blight"" on the country. ""They hurt our country very badly,"" he said. ""And smart countries don't use it."" A view of a solar plant in Richmond, California. The cost of solar and wind projects has fallen dramatically. In the U.S., these industries have been helped for decades by federal tax incentives. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption Renewable energy was the top source of new electricity generation globally last year, with much of it installed in China, according to the International Energy Agency . ""Chinese leadership does understand how big a problem climate change is. They're getting hurt by climate impacts,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. But, he says, ""once you get into it, you're like, 'Oh, wait a minute — this just makes economic sense.'"" The cost of wind and solar projects has fallen dramatically. In the U.S., those industries — like the fossil fuel sector — have also been helped for decades by federal tax incentives. ""Wind is a critical part of our nation's all-of-the-above energy strategy,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who calls himself the ""father"" of the wind-energy tax credit, said several years ago when wind farms became his state's biggest source of electricity. ""It creates thousands of jobs, supports economic development, boosts tax receipts, attracts investment in our state and puts extra money in farmers' pockets."" But for years, renewable energy executives and advocates have debated when and how to get off subsidies. Those discussions ramped up when the incentives were threatened by Congress, says Paula Mints, founder and chief analyst at SPV Market Research. ""I think we've become complacent, dependent on these tax credits, and I think we need to finally phase them out,"" Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures, said this month as the Senate debated cutting the incentives as part of the tax-and-spending bill. However, the industry urged lawmakers to unwind the tax credits gradually to give companies time to adjust. What companies have gotten instead is chaos. ""I would characterize this as a high degree of volatility expected over the next year,"" says Ryan Sweezey, director of North America power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research firm. ""I mean, the policy situation is still not clear."" Under a deal struck by Republican senators, wind and solar projects are eligible for tax incentives as long as companies start construction within the next year and finish within four. That timeline was in the bill that Trump signed on July 4, setting up a scramble for companies to begin working on as many projects as possible. But that was upended last week when Trump issued an executive order that directs the Treasury secretary to consider issuing new guidance for what companies have to do to meet the government's ""beginning of construction"" standard. The goal is to keep companies from circumventing tax laws, according to the order. Now, companies that build wind and solar projects are trying to figure out whether investors are going to put their deals on hold until they know what the administration will do, says Keith Martin, a lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright. ""This Trump era is like trying to do business while bouncing up and down on a trampoline,"" Martin says, adding, ""It's very hard to do business in that atmosphere."" President Trump signs his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House on July 4. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption The moves have thrown America's wind and solar industries into turmoil at a time when electricity demand is expected to increase significantly for the first time in decades. Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap . Those wind and solar plants will get more expensive when tax incentives disappear, potentially changing companies' investment decisions. New power generation in the U.S. is expected to fall by about a third over the next decade, mainly due to wind and solar projects that won't come online, says O'Brien of Energy Innovation. While renewables are technically the cheapest source of new power generation , even without government subsidies, that doesn't account for the cost of tying intermittent resources into the power grid. As more wind and solar comes online, investing in things like batteries becomes more important so that electricity can be delivered when it's needed. At the same time that activity in the renewables market is expected to slow, a shortage of gas turbines will prevent companies from building more natural gas plants than they had already planned to bring online in the next five years, according to Energy Innovation. ""We're already running our cheaper gas generation facilities a lot in the U.S.,"" O'Brien says. ""And we have more capacity. We can dip into that in more hours. But those are the generators that cost more per hour to run."" Operating those plants could get even more expensive as gas demand rises. The U.S. Energy Information Administration already expected prices for the fuel to increase , mainly due to demand from facilities that export liquified natural gas around the world. ""The timing here is not great,"" says Sweezey of Wood Mackenzie. Under the law Trump signed this month, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall by 25% by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, according to an analysis by the ZERO Lab at Princeton University and Evolved Energy Research. That's little progress from where the U.S. is now. Gary Hershorn/Corbis News via Getty hide caption While electricity rates are expected to skyrocket in some states, Energy Innovation says costs are likely to rise across the country. Nationally, rates will increase by 9% to 18% on average by 2035, the firm says , and the U.S. will lose out on billions of dollars in planned investment and hundreds of thousands of jobs. Renewable energy manufacturing could get hit especially hard. Companies that have opened U.S. factories to make solar panels and other components have said abruptly unwinding clean energy tax incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector. The tax credits that are being eliminated encourage companies that build power plants to buy American-made products, like solar panels and other components. The U.S. will also cut less of the climate pollution that's contributing to more intense storms, floods and wildfires. Under Republicans' new tax-and-spending law, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall by 25% by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, according to an analysis by the ZERO Lab at Princeton University and Evolved Energy Research. That's little progress from where the country is now. Last year, emissions were about 20% below 2005 levels, according to the Rhodium Group , a research firm. Under Biden-era policies, emissions would have fallen by at least 40% from 2005 levels by 2035, researchers at the ZERO Lab and Evolved Energy Research said. ""I don't think subsidizing electricity just as a general matter necessarily makes sense,"" says Noah Kaufman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Joe Biden. However, tax incentives for clean energy were extended during the Biden administration ""as part of a broader strategy,"" Kaufman says, ""to address climate change and to better prepare the U.S. energy system and economy for the global energy transition."" ""Now,"" Kaufman adds, ""I think it's fair to say the Trump administration doesn't share either of those goals."""
20,Science,"Titanosauruses in the movie ""Jurassic World: Rebirth"", directed by Gareth Edwards. Universal Studios hide caption Titanosauruses in the movie ""Jurassic World: Rebirth"", directed by Gareth Edwards. Picture you're sitting in the plush seats of a movie theater. There's popcorn in your lap and a pack of Sour Patch Kids next to you. On screen you're staring at an enormous T-Rex chasing its prey. That's part of the plot of many movies in the Jurassic Park franchise. And while dinosaur paleontologist Matt Lamanna has loved dinosaurs — and the Jurassic Park franchise — his whole life, he says some of the movies are more accurate than others. For example, in the original film, a major plot point is that the T-Rex can't see park-goers if they aren't moving. Lamanna says that is ""extra problematic with T-Rex because it probably had...some of the best visual acuity in any dinosaur."" Lamanna works at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, which he recently gave Short Wave host Regina G. Barber a tour of. Along the way, they discussed the accuracy of the beloved giant creatures in the newest Jurassic World film, as well as some of the hits from the franchise's archive — like the dinosaur he was partially responsible for discovering, the Dreadnoughtus .

21,Science,"A damaged home is seen after flash flooding in Hunt, Texas, on July 4. Just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Nearly every county in the United States has experienced flooding in the past few decades, but just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency . It's what experts call the flood insurance gap . Most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flooding . And while FEMA aid may be available to help people repair their homes after federally declared disasters , it often covers just a fraction of the costs. That means when floodwaters come, people frequently are on their own to pick up the pieces. It's a reality communities across the country are facing after flooding hit parts of Texas , New Mexico and North Carolina in the past week alone. In all three states, the floods were caused by extremely heavy rainfall inland — a risk that's growing with climate change . A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. As temperatures rise, it's fueling more intense rainstorms that drop more water in shorter periods of time. One solution: Homeowners, renters and businesses can buy flood insurance, which most people get through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program , says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, which assesses property risks from climate change. Federal flood insurance offers up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for nonresidential buildings . People can buy policies that also cover the belongings inside their home, including clothing and furniture. The program is open to anyone who lives in one of the approximately 22,600 communities that have adopted certain standards to regulate development in their floodplains. Porter estimates that people living in more than 90% of U.S. counties are eligible. For people who want flood insurance but live outside of a qualifying community, they would have to go to the private market. ""It's clear that [flood] insurance protects property owners and it protects the communities,"" Porter says. ""It ends up keeping property values from dropping, post-event. It ultimately ends up keeping properties from going into foreclosure."" In some places, though, federal flood insurance is unaffordable for many residents, and costs are rising around the country. So, people ""roll the dice, hope [a flood] doesn't happen,"" says Brian O'Connell, an analyst at insuranceQuotes, an online platform where people can compare and buy insurance. ""And when it does happen — and we talk to people who it happens to — it's one of the worst things people ever experience in their lives."" Heavy rains from Hurricane Helene caused record flooding and damage last year in Asheville, N.C. As climate change raises global temperatures, it's fueling more intense rainstorms that drop more water in shorter periods of time. Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images hide caption The U.S. government created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 when private companies stopped offering coverage. The federal program, which is backed by taxpayers, has been chronically in debt, borrowing from the Treasury to pay claims. Several years ago, FEMA began overhauling how the flood program sets its prices . Now, premiums are based on a home's value, FEMA says, and the flood risk an individual property faces. That's a more granular approach than the government used before. FEMA says one of the goals is to encourage actions that reduce flood risks. As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S. In Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, for example, where 9 out of 10 homes are at risk of flooding , people are looking at paying more than $5,400 a year for flood insurance, an average increase of more than 500%. That's on top of their regular home insurance costs. ""The guy with a million dollar house, he'll figure it out,"" says Anderson Baker, a retired insurance executive in Louisiana. ""The guy with a $150,000 house, a couple hundred dollars extra a month, or $300 extra a month, that's a life-changing increase in his premium."" O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance. There are companies that have started to offer flood insurance again, which creates some competition for the federal program, says Porter of First Street. However, private insurers only cover 12% of the market, according to First Street . For some people, taking on the added expense of flood insurance isn't much of a choice . Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance. Properties that have received federal disaster aid in the past also must be covered by flood insurance to qualify for future assistance. And in Florida , the state-backed insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., has started requiring homeowners that have coverage for wind damage to also buy flood insurance. If a lot more people bought flood insurance, it would drive down the cost of coverage and could entice more private insurers into the market, says Michelle Osborne, director of the Risk Management Institute at Campbell University. But as things stand, the cost of flood insurance is often a dealbreaker for people, says O'Connell of insuranceQuotes, especially since many doubt they need protection. ""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive. ""But everybody's in a flood zone. People at the top of a mountain are in a flood zone. They're just in a good flood zone."""
22,Science,"A Glaucus atlanticus eats a Porpita. Both are residents of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Oxford Scientific/Getty Images hide caption A Glaucus atlanticus eats a Porpita. Both are residents of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Welcome to episode two of NPR Short Wave 's summer series, Sea Camp ! Today, we linger at the surface and revisit an episode about an ocean conundrum: Trash from humans is constantly spilling into the ocean — so much so that there are five gigantic garbage patches in the seas. They hang out at the nexus of the world's ocean currents, changing shape with the waves. The largest is the North Pacific Garbage Patch, known colloquially as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch . These areas were long thought to have been uninhabited, the plastics and fishing gear too harmful to marine life. But researchers have uncovered a whole ecosystem of life in this largest collection of trash. ""This research has shown me that there is more life than we expected there ... a whole ecosystem that are in the middle of the patch,"" says marine biologist Fiona Chong. The most common inhabitants include: Porpita (also called ""blue button""), a small disc-like animal with ""tentacles"" radiating outward, closely related to jellyfish; Velella (also called the ""by-the-wind-sailor""), which looks like a flat disc with a kind of ""sail"" running across the top; and Janthina a violet sea snail that traps bubbles to stay afloat. These and other organisms that float freely atop the water are called neuston . Neuston form an ecosystem and food web amongst themselves. Janthina are known to eat both Velella and Porpita. Glaucus atlanticus , another neuston observed in very small quantities in the patch, is another predator. Known as the ""blue sea dragon,"" it prefers to snack on the Portuguese man o' war but has been known to chomp on both Porpita and Velella . These marine animals are also are part of a larger ecosystem. Chong notes that Porpita are known to sometimes form symbiotic partnerships with small, juvenile fish that are stressed when removed from their individual Porpita . Plus, animals like the ocean sunfish, seabirds and sea turtles are known to munch on neuston. ""It's a shame that us humans have such large impacts in the ocean that, you know, our footprint is so far out,"" she says. ""Plastic being in the patch could be harmful for other marine organisms."" For Chong, the realization that animals call the Great Pacific Garbage Patch home has made her reconsider efforts aim at indiscriminately cleaning up the trash. She also hopes that the findings will make people and the fishing industry more aware of their footprint and lead to better waste management systems. That's because for her, one of the most ideal solutions to the ocean debris problem is curbing plastic use. If less is used in the first place, less will eventually make its way to the ocean. ""That is probably quite difficult, but we should try it,"" she says. To go even deeper with the marine research each week of Sea Camp, sign up for our newsletter !

23,Science,"A Martian meteorite said to be the largest piece of Mars on Earth, estimated at $2 - 4 million, is displayed at Sotheby's, in New York. Richard Drew/AP hide caption NEW YORK — For sale: A 54-pound (25-kilogram) rock. Estimated auction price: $2 million to $4 million. Why so expensive? It's the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth. Sotheby's in New York will be auctioning what's known as NWA 16788 on Wednesday as part of a natural history-themed sale that also includes a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton that's more than 6 feet (2 meters) tall and nearly 11 feet (3 meters) long. According to the auction house, the meteorite is believed to have been blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth, where it crashed into the Sahara. A meteorite hunter found it in Niger in November 2023, Sotheby's says. The red, brown and gray hunk is about 70% larger than the next largest piece of Mars found on Earth and represents nearly 7% of all the Martian material currently on this planet, Sotheby's says. It measures nearly 15 inches by 11 inches by 6 inches (375 millimeters by 279 millimeters by 152 millimeters). ""This Martian meteorite is the largest piece of Mars we have ever found by a long shot,"" Cassandra Hatton, vice chairman for science and natural history at Sotheby's, said in an interview. ""So it's more than double the size of what we previously thought was the largest piece of Mars."" It is also a rare find. There are only 400 Martian meteorites out of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth, Sotheby's says. Hatton said a small piece of the red planet remnant was removed and sent to a specialized lab that confirmed it is from Mars. It was compared with the distinct chemical composition of Martian meteorites discovered during the Viking space probe that landed on Mars in 1976, she said. The examination found that it is an ""olivine-microgabbroic shergottite,"" a type of Martian rock formed from the slow cooling of Martian magma. It has a coarse-grained texture and contains the minerals pyroxene and olivine, Sotheby's says. It also has a glassy surface, likely due to the high heat that burned it when it fell through Earth's atmosphere, Hatton said. ""So that was their first clue that this wasn't just some big rock on the ground,"" she said. The meteorite previously was on exhibit at the Italian Space Agency in Rome. Sotheby's did not disclose the owner. It's not clear exactly when the meteorite hit Earth, but testing shows it probably happened in recent years, Sotheby's said. The juvenile Ceratosaurus nasicornis skeleton was found in 1996 near Laramie, Wyoming, at Bone Cabin Quarry, a gold mine for dinosaur bones. Specialists assembled nearly 140 fossil bones with some sculpted materials to recreate the skeleton and mounted it so it's ready to exhibit, Sotheby's says. The skeleton is believed to be from the late Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago, Sotheby's says. It's auction estimate is $4 million to $6 million. Ceratosaurus dinosaurs were bipeds with short arms that appear similar to the Tyrannosaurus rex, but smaller. Ceratosaurus dinosaurs could grow up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) long, while the Tyrannosaurs rex could be 40 feet (12 meters) long. The skeleton was acquired last year by Fossilogic, a Utah-based fossil preparation and mounting company. Wednesday's auction is part of Sotheby's Geek Week 2025 and features 122 items, including other meteorites, fossils and gem-quality minerals."
0,Health,"Sonya Sotinsky sits at Crane Cove Park in San Francisco on March 25. Sotinsky was diagnosed with Stage 4 tongue cancer and underwent surgery to remove her tongue, larynx and other structures. She then worked with researchers to create an AI-generated voice using past recordings of her speech. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption When doctors told her they had to remove her tongue and voice box to save her life from the cancer that had invaded her mouth, Sonya Sotinsky sat down with a microphone to record herself saying the things she would never again be able to say. This story was produced in partnership with KFF Health News . ""Happy birthday"" and ""I'm proud of you"" topped the phrases she banked for her husband and two daughters, as well as ""I'll be right with you,"" intended for customers at the architecture firm she co-owns in Tucson, Arizona. Thinking about the grandchildren she desperately hoped to see born one day, she also recorded herself reading more than a dozen children's books, from Eloise to Dr. Seuss, to one day play for them at bedtime. But one of the biggest categories of sound files she banked was a string of curse words and filthy sayings. If the voice is the primary expression of personality, sarcasm and profanity are essential to Sotinsky's. ""When you can't use your voice, it is very, very frustrating. Other people project what they think your personality is. I have silently screamed and screamed at there being no scream,"" said Sotinsky in a recent interview, referring to rudimentary voice technology or writing notes by hand. ""What the literal you-know-what?"" Fighting invasive oral cancer at age 51 forced Sotinsky to confront the existential importance of the human voice. Her unique intonation, cadence and slight New Jersey accent, she felt, were fingerprints of her identity. And she refused to be silenced. Sonya Sotinsky uses an app on her phone to talk with her daughter Ela Fuentevilla at Crane Cove Park in San Francisco on March 25. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption While her doctors and insurance company saved her life, they showed little interest in saving her voice, she said. So she set out on her own to research and identify the artificial intelligence company that could. It used the recordings Sotinsky banked of her natural voice to build an exact replica now stored in an app on her phone, allowing her to type and speak once again with a full range of sentiment and sarcasm. ""She got her sass back,"" said Sotinsky's daughter, Ela Fuentevilla, 23. ""When we heard her AI voice, we all cried, my sister, my dad and I. It's crazy similar."" It took close to a year for doctors to catch Sotinsky's cancer. She complained to her orthodontist and dentist multiple times about jaw pain and a strange sensation under her tongue. Then water began dribbling down her chin when she drank. When the pain got so intense she could no longer speak at the end of each day, Sotinsky insisted her orthodontist take a closer look. ""A shadow cast over his face. I saw it when he leaned back,"" she said, ""that look you don't want to see."" That's when she started recording. In the five weeks between her diagnosis and surgery to remove her entire tongue and voice box – in medical terms, a total glossectomy and laryngectomy – she banked as much of her voice as she could manage. ""Your voice is your identity,"" said Dr. Sue Yom , a radiation oncologist at UC-San Francisco, where Sotinsky got treatment. ""Communication is not only how we express ourselves and relate to other people, but also how we make sense of the world."" ""When the voice is no longer available, you can't hear yourself thinking out loud, you can't hear yourself interacting with other people,"" Yom said. ""It impacts how your mind works."" People who lose their voice box, she added, are at higher risk for long-term emotional distress , depression and physical pain compared with those who retain it after cancer treatment. Close to a third lose their job , and the social isolation can be profound. Most laryngectomy patients learn to speak again with an electrolarynx , a small battery-operated box held against the throat that produces a monotonic, mechanical voice. But without a tongue to shape her words, Sotinsky knew that wouldn't work for her. Dr. Sue Yom, a radiation oncologist, stands with a radiotherapy system used to deliver precise, high-dose radiation treatments for cancer patients at the University of California San Francisco's Mission Bay medical center on May 16. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption When Sotinsky had her surgery in January 2022, AI voices were still in their infancy. The best technology she could find yielded a synthetic version of her voice, but it was still flat and robotic, and others strained to understand her. She got by until mid-2024, when she read about tech companies using generative AI to replicate a person's full range of natural inflection and emotion. While companies can now recreate a person's voice from snippets of old home movies or even a one-minute voicemail, 30 minutes is the sweet spot. Sotinsky had banked hours in her children's book readings. ""Eloise saved my voice,"" Sotinsky said. Now she types what she wants to say into a text-to-speech app on her phone, called Whisper , which translates and broadcasts her AI voice through portable speakers. Sonya Sotinsky often uses a portable keyboard to talk using the text-to-speech software on her phone. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption Most doctors and speech therapists who work with head and neck cancer patients don't realize AI software can be used this way, Yom said, and with their focus on saving lives they often don't have the bandwidth to encourage patients to record their voices before they lose them in surgery. Health insurance companies likewise prioritize treatments that extend life over those that improve its quality — and typically avoid covering new technologies until data proves their actuarial value. Sotinsky and her daughter spent months wrangling with claims adjusters at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona , but the insurer refused to reimburse Sotinsky for the $3,000 she spent on her initial assistive speaking technology. ""Apparently, having a voice is not considered a medical necessity,"" Sotinsky quipped, her AI voice edged with sarcasm. Sotinsky now pays the $99 monthly fee for her AI voice clone out of pocket. ""While health plans cover both routine and life-saving care, assistive communication devices are typically not covered,"" said Teresa Joseph , a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. ""As AI provides opportunities to impact health, we imagine that coverage criteria will evolve nationally."" Sotinsky resolved to use her newfound voice to help others regain theirs. She stepped back from her work in architecture and built two websites detailing her voice banking journey — voicebanknow.com and glossectomygirl.com . She tells her story at conferences and webinars, including an oncology conference in Denver that Yom organized for 80 scientists. One doctor who attended, Jennifer De Los Santos , was so inspired by hearing Sotinsky's voice that she began laying the groundwork for a clinical trial on the impact AI technology has on patients' communication and quality of life. That type of research could generate the data health insurers need to measure actuarial value. ""And therefore justify coverage by insurance,"" said De Los Santos, a head and neck cancer researcher and professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Breast cancer survivors faced a similar battle in the 1980s and '90s, she added. Insurers initially refused to cover the cost of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, calling the procedure cosmetic and unnecessary. It took years of patient advocacy and carefully crafted data showing reconstruction had a profound impact on women's physical and emotional well-being before the federal government mandated insurance coverage in 1998. Both De Los Santos and Yom said research data on AI voice clones will likely follow a similar path, eventually proving that a fully functioning, natural-sounding voice can lead to not only a better life, but a longer one. Sonya Sotinsky has built two websites detailing her experience in voice banking and tells her story at conferences, including an oncology conference in Denver for 80 scientists. Beth LaBerge/KQED hide caption In recent months, Sotinsky's AI voice literally helped save her life. Her cancer had resurged in her lungs and liver. Her voice allowed her to communicate with her doctors and participate fully in developing the treatment plan. It showed her just how ""medically necessary"" having a voice is. She noticed that doctors and nurses took her more seriously. They didn't tune out the way people often did when she relied on her more robotic, synthesized voice. It seemed they saw her as more fully human. ""If someone can only communicate using a few words at a time, and not elaborate and interface more fully, it's natural that you can't detect that they have more depth of thought,"" she said. ""Being able to dialogue with my care team in a more seamless way is vital."" While doctors successfully treated her latest round of cancer, Sotinsky, now 55, said she is confronting her odds in a new way, facing the reality that she will likely die much sooner than she wants. All over again, she realized how crucial her voice is for maintaining perspective on life and a sense of humor in the face of death. ""I tend to forget and think I am fine, when in reality, this is forever now. Emotionally, you start to get cocky again and this was like, 'Whoa, b****, we ain't playing.' This cancer is real,"" Sotinsky said, typing her next phrase with a mischievous grin. ""Sarcasm is part of my love language.""

1,Health,"In Montana, one man says Medicaid and the drug coverage he gets through it are what allow him to work. But a raise he has gotten could mean he loses Medicaid, so he says he decided to ""fudge the numbers."" Oona Zenda/KFF Health News hide caption MISSOULA, Mont. — As congressional Republicans finalized Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, one man who relies on that government-subsidized health coverage was trying to coax his old car to start after an eight-hour shift making sandwiches. James asked that only his middle name be used to tell his story so that he wouldn't lose health coverage or be accused of Medicaid fraud. He found his food service gig a few weeks into an addiction treatment program. The man, who is in his late 30s, said his boss ""hasn't been disappointed."" ""I'm a good worker,"" he said with a grin. James can get the prescription drugs that help him stabilize his life and hold down that job through Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program that covers people with low incomes or disabilities. Those drugs curb his desire for alcohol and treat long-standing conditions that exacerbate his addiction, including bipolar and insomnia disorders. But he hasn't qualified for the program in months, ever since his work hours increased and he received a raise of about $1 an hour. He exceeds his income eligibility limit of about $21,000 per year by roughly $50 a week. James said that despite his raise, he's struggling to cover routine expenses, such as keeping his car running and paying his phone bill. He said he can't afford the care he needs even on the cheapest insurance plan available to him through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace or through his job's health insurance plan. Even paying $60 a month for his sleep medications — one of six prescriptions he takes daily — is too expensive. ""I only saw one option,"" James said. ""Fudge the numbers."" James hasn't reported his new income to the state. That puts him at odds with congressional Republicans who justified adding hurdles to Medicaid by claiming the system is rife with waste, fraud and abuse. But James isn't someone sitting on his couch playing video games, the type of person House Speaker Mike Johnson and others said they would target as they sought to impose work requirements. Medicaid provides health coverage and long-term care to more than 70 million people in the United States. Those who study safety-net systems say it's extremely rare for enrollees to commit fraud to tap into that coverage. In fact, research shows that swaths of eligible people aren't enrolled in Medicaid, likely because the system is so confusing. And nearly two-thirds of people on Medicaid in 2023 had jobs, according to an analysis by KFF , a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Those transitioning off Medicaid may qualify for other subsidized or low-priced health plans through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace. But, as in James' case, such plans can have gaps in what care is covered, and more comprehensive private plans may be too expensive. So James and an unknown number of other people find themselves caught between working too much to qualify for Medicaid but earning too little to pay for their own health care. James considers himself to be a patriot and said that people shouldn't ""use government funding to just be lazy."" He agrees with the Republican argument that, if able, people should work if they receive Medicaid. “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” “I don’t want to be a fraud. I don’t want to die. Those shouldn’t be the only two options.” James Hiding his hours on the job from the government bothers him, especially since he feels he must lie to access the medical care that enables him to work. ""I don't want to be a fraud. I don't want to die,"" James said. ""Those shouldn't be the only two options."" On July 4, Trump signed into law the major tax and spending bill that makes it harder for low-income workers to get Medicaid. That includes requiring beneficiaries to work or go to school and adding paperwork to prove they meet a minimum number of hours on the job every six months. ""It's going to hurt people, whether they're playing by the rules or not,"" said Ben Sommers , a health economist at Harvard University. ""We see this vilification of mostly very hardworking people who are really struggling and are benefiting from a program that helps them stay alive."" James said he initially declined his raise because he worried about losing Medicaid. He had previously been kicked off the coverage about a month into his rehab program after finding work. To stay in the sober-living program he otherwise couldn't afford, James said, he dropped just enough hours at work to requalify for Medicaid and then soon picked up hours again. If he didn't earn more, he said, he had no chance of saving enough money to find housing after graduating from the treatment program. ""They'll give you a bone if you stay in the mud,"" James said. ""But you have to stay there."" That problem — becoming just successful enough to suddenly lose Medicaid — is common. It's called a benefit cliff, said Pamela Herd , who researches government aid at the University of Michigan. ""It just doesn't make any sense that someone gets a dollar pay raise and all of a sudden they lose all access to their health insurance,"" Herd said. She said a partial fix exists called continuous eligibility, which guarantees an individual's Medicaid coverage for a specific period, such as a year or longer. The goal is to give people time to adjust when they do earn more money. Continuous eligibility also helps maintain coverage for low-income workers with unpredictable hours and whose pay changes month to month. But Congress has moved in the other direction. Under the new law, policymakers limited windows of eligibility for able-bodied adults to every six months. That will put more people on the program's eligibility cliff, Herd said, in which they must decide between losing access to coverage or dropping hours at work. ""It is going to be a nightmare,"" Herd said. Those federal changes will be especially difficult for people with chronic conditions, such as James in Montana. Not that long ago, James wouldn't have been breaking the rules to access Medicaid because his state had 12-month continuous eligibility. But in 2023, Montana began requiring enrollees to report any change in their income within 10 days. James is proud of how far he has come. About a year ago, his body was breaking down. He couldn't hold a spoon to eat breakfast without whiskey — his hands shook too hard. He had alcohol-induced seizures. He said his memories from his unhealthiest times come in flashes: being put on a stretcher, the face of a worried landlord, ambulance lights in the background. James recently graduated from his treatment program. He's staying with a relative to save money as he and his girlfriend try to find an affordable place to rent — though even with Medicaid, finding housing feels like a stretch to him. He's taking classes part time to become a licensed addiction counselor. His dream is to help others survive addiction, and he also sees that career as a way out of poverty. To James, all his progress rides on keeping Medicaid a bit longer. ""Every time I get a piece of mail, I am terrified that I'm gonna open it up and it's gonna say I don't have Medicaid anymore,"" he said. ""I'm constantly in fear that it's gonna go away."" As of mid-July, officials hadn't noticed the extra $50 he makes each week.

2,Health,"Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez, D-N.M., speaks in favor of reauthorizing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 2024. The legislation, which will benefit people sickened by radiation exposure in uranium mining and nuclear weapons testing, was included in the budget bill President Trump signed on July 4, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images hide caption Children who lived near a St. Louis creek polluted with radioactive atomic bomb waste from the 1940s through the 1960s were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer over their lifetimes than children who lived farther from the waterway, a new study has found. The findings, published in JAMA Network Open, corroborate worries that neighbors of Coldwater Creek have long held about the Missouri River tributary where generations of children played. ""We actually saw something quite dramatic, not only elevated risk of cancer, but one that increased steadily in a sort of dose-response manner the closer the childhood residents got to Coldwater Creek,"" said the study's senior author, Marc Weisskopf, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As part of the Manhattan Project, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works processed uranium in St. Louis for the development of an atomic bomb. By the mid-1940s, according to historians, the company began to haul its radioactive waste north of the city, leaving it in open steel drums, unattended and exposed to the elements, next to Coldwater Creek. The study's release comes shortly after passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" which contained a little-known provision to help people sickened by exposure to nuclear waste in Missouri and elsewhere. It provides payments of $25,000 to families of people who died as a result of radiation-linked cancers in the St. Louis area and $50,000 to those who developed the cancers and survived. Like the new study, the provision recognizes the potential health risks from lower radiation levels associated with the production of the atomic bomb. Previous legislation, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act , known as RECA, expired last year after paying out $2.6 billion to people who developed cancer after exposure to high-dose radiation from participating in onsite atomic weapon testing, mining or hauling uranium or being downwind of the Nevada test site. U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, made sure the RECA reauthorization was included in the recently passed budget bill and that it included benefits for his constituents who lived near the contaminated creek. Al Drago/Getty Images hide caption Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, pushed to get a new version of RECA into the Trump budget bill. Hawley had been a vocal critic of the BBB's $900 billion cut to Medicaid, but in the end voted for the massive package of tax and spending cuts. Hawley's yes vote came after a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals was added to the BBB. Weisskopf and his research team had the addresses of 4,209 tooth donors from the St. Louis Baby Tooth Survey. Participants, born between 1945 and 1966, donated their baby teeth for science starting in 1958 and joined the new experiment between 2021 and 2024. Weisskopf initially planned to study cognitive decline, but after participants repeatedly mentioned Coldwater Creek, he pivoted to investigating proximity to the creek and cancer risk. Almost one-quarter of the participants reported having cancer. Those who lived within one kilometer of the creek as children were 44% more likely to report having cancer than those who lived more than 20 kilometers away. Even more striking, those who lived within one kilometer of the creek were 85% more likely to have radiosensitive cancers, cancers believed to be caused by radiation. Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist and epidemiology professor at the University of California, said she was impressed with the design of the study, with which she was not involved. ""This study adds to our understanding that radiation is carcinogenic and that we have to be cautious to minimize exposures to radiation wherever possible,"" she said. The main source of exposure today comes from medical imaging, she said. The study also highlights the need to clean up areas, like shipyards, with radioactive waste, she said. Male study participants were more likely than female participants to develop cancer, Smith-Bindman noted. She and Weisskopf hypothesized that the boys were more likely to play in Coldwater Creek in the aftermath of World War II. In 1958, scientists at Washington University began collecting the baby teeth of children from St. Louis. The teeth were used in studies investigating possible links between cancer and the fallout from nuclear tests in the western U.S. St. Louis was chosen not because of its connection to uranium production but because milk in the Midwest had some of the nation's highest levels of strontium-90, a radioactive isotope produced by nuclear fission. High concentrations of strontium-90 found in donated baby teeth contributed to the adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. A 2011 study found that men who were children in St. Louis in the 1960s and died of cancer by middle age had more than twice as much radioactive strontium in their baby teeth as men who grew up nearby and were still alive. Though he did not use the baby teeth in his current study, Weisskopf would like to measure strontium-90 in the teeth in a future study to assess cancer risk and actual exposure. ""As boys, they might have played in the creek way more than girls, and so they got much more exposure,"" he said. ""If that were the case, then the radiation in the teeth should be higher in the boys than in the girls."" Given that the half-life of strontium-90 is 29 years, Weisskopf is eager to begin work on a more detailed study while radiation remains in the baby teeth."
3,Health,"A child receives a cholera vaccine at a temporary treatment center during a past outbreak in Lusaka, Zambia. Namukolo Siyumbwa/Reuters hide caption In South Korea, there's a long hallway lined with walk-in refrigerators. Inside are boxes filled with oral cholera vaccines. This is the emergency cholera vaccine stockpile — and boxes are flying off the shelves to places like Angola, Sudan and South Sudan. ""At the moment, we're shipping about 5 million doses every month, so this means that as soon as the box comes in, another one is going out,"" says Allyson Russell, an epidemiologist at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and a senior program manager for outbreaks and global health security. Gavi, a global public-private organization, funds the stockpile and aims to have a little more than 5 million doses available at any given time, although it has had trouble in the past meeting this target. There are similar stockpiles around the world. In freezers in Switzerland, there are Ebola vaccines. Elsewhere there are meningitis vaccines stored up; same with yellow fever vaccines. While some are kept at ultra-cold temperatures, like the Ebola vaccines, most only need to be refrigerated. ""Imagine sticking your hand in a refrigerator to get out your groceries,"" says Russell. The first global stockpile was established in 1997 when major meningitis outbreaks in Africa prompted public health crisis. The vaccines are available to any country in the world. These stockpiles are now in the spotlight because, for the first time, researchers have quantified just how many lives have been saved by drawing on the stored vaccines. But this news comes against the backdrop of uncertainty. There are new concerns about what the future of these global stockpiles will look like amid a major drop in global health funding. Russell spends her days immersed in the details of the stockpile system. She knows which countries have emailed in the form to request doses from the stockpile. She knows whether the doses are being raced to an outbreak via chartered flight or in the cargo of a commercial airplane. And one thing is clear to her. ""You can see how vaccines change the trajectory of what happens [in an outbreak],"" she says. ""Vaccine can really be a game changer."" But, she says, she's never known exactly how much of a ""game changer"" these stockpiles are — until now. Researchers have crunched the numbers. They looked at more than 200 outbreaks over the past 20-some years, modeling what would happen without the vaccines. Nick Scott , a co-author of the study published this month in the British Medical Journal — Global Health , says the results were exciting: A 60% reduction in cases and deaths from outbreaks because of the stockpile. ""That's quite an amazing thing,"" said Scott, who is head of modeling and biostatistics at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, an independent medical research group. That 60% drop means about 6 million cases were averted and 300,000 deaths were averted. ""This study really was meant to ask the question of, are GAVI stockpiles worthwhile? Is it worthwhile to have them?"" says Dr. Ruth Karron , who is director of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative and was not involved in the study. ""And I think that the answer — very robustly — is absolutely."" The research — which was funded by Gavi and started in early 2024 with the goal of helping inform its strategic planning — found over $32 billion dollars in economic benefits from the stockpiles, given there were fewer deaths and less disability in the 200-some outbreaks researchers considered. The researchers say this is a significant underestimate and the true economic benefits are likely much higher. That's because this calculation does not take into account things like the cost of outbreak response that are avoided or the economic disruptions created by large outbreaks. Based on Gavi's financial planning documents , procurement for the stockpiles costs less than $100 million a year. Scott's team also found that speed really matters. ""When there is an outbreak, the faster the vaccine response can start, the more impactful it will be,"" he says. This matters because containing a disease's spread can mean avoiding huge social disruptions. ""What we found is that these vaccines are really critical for preventing things like school closures, business closures, travel restrictions,"" Scott said. The importance of speed is one of the reasons the stockpiles exist in the first place. ""It can easily take up to a year to make these vaccines. Ebola vaccines take a year. Meningitis vaccines take about four to six months,"" Russell says. ""If you were to place the order and then make the vaccines, who knows what would happen to the outbreak."" However, Scott says, having the vaccines ready is not enough. There also need to be mechanisms in place to get the doses to the outbreak and then administer them to people who live and work in the affected area. As international aid organizations face historic funding cuts these steps could get harder. Karron says the findings come at a particularly important time. Global health funding is dropping to a 15-year low, according to a study published this month in the medical journal The Lancet. And it's forcing international health organizations to grapple with what they can afford to keep and what they have to let go. These days everything is on the table, including the global stockpiles of emergency vaccines, says Karron. Gavi is almost $3 billion short of its budget goal for the next five years. Part of the shortfall comes from the U.S. announcing last month that it will cut off support for Gavi until it is able to ""re-earn the public trust."" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explained the decision by saying Gavi had neglected issues of vaccine safety, an accusation Gavi vigorously denies. Critics says the study RFK Jr. cited as evidence is flawed. This week, the organization's board is meeting to figure out what to prioritize. ""So obviously, everything is up for question,"" Karron says. One challenge with the stockpiles is that stored doses can expire, explains Karron. Doses made for routine immunizations are, generally, used quickly and don't bump up against their expiration dates. That's not a guarantee with the stockpile. Gavi does have a system where once vaccines in the stockpile reach one year left in their shelf life, they can be used in a preventive program — for example in a high-risk location where researchers anticipate meningitis outbreaks. However, Karron says, that is not always possible. ""So, the question is: Is it worth the investment knowing that you might have some vaccine that goes to waste?"" she asks. She says the clear answer from this study is that it's in everyone's interest to keep the emergency vaccine stockpiles fully stocked. ""If we don't want some of these diseases, like Ebola, to come to our [U.S.] shores, we really need to contain them at the source,"" Karron says."
4,Health,"Democratic lawmakers have reintroduced a set of bills called the ""Safer Beauty Bill Package,"" aiming to bring safety and transparency to the largely unregulated cosmetics industry. Nadia Audigie/Getty Images hide caption Personal care, salon and beauty products sold across the U.S. are subject to little federal oversight — and many have been found to contain toxic ingredients. The average American adult uses about 12 personal care products a day, Consumer Reports says , resulting in exposure to an average of 168 chemicals. Those can include formaldehyde, mercury, asbestos, lead and parabens, which have been linked to cancer, brain damage and reproductive harm. Women of color are thought to use twice as many products, according to Consumer Reports . Despite mounting scientific research into the dangers posed by toxic chemicals, little has been done to ban them or at least label them on cosmetics. A group of Democratic lawmakers hopes to change that. On Wednesday, Reps. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, Doris Matsui of California and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced the "" Safer Beauty Bill Package ,"" a set of four bills designed to update what they call ""an increasingly outdated set of federal cosmetics laws."" Each focuses on a different aspect of product safety, from banning the most toxic ingredients in everyday beauty supplies to creating protections for the women of color and salon workers who are disproportionately exposed to them. ""More than 10,000 chemicals are used to make beauty and personal care products,"" said Schakowsky , who authored all four bills. ""We owe it to consumers to ensure the beauty and personal care products they use daily are safe."" This is an updated version of a similar package that lawmakers first introduced in 2021. In 2022, then-President Biden signed into law the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA), which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) calls the most significant expansion of its authority to regulate cosmetics since its creation in 1938. The law gave the FDA power to do things like issue mandatory recalls, require adverse event reporting and suspend manufacturers' facility registration. But lawmakers and consumer safety advocates say it did little to actually improve the safety of beauty and personal care products. The lack of federal action has driven some states — including Vermont, California, Washington and Oregon — to enact their own bans on dozens of chemicals from cosmetic products in recent years. The FDA did not comment when asked about the legislation. The Personal Care Products Council — a leading cosmetics trade industry — told NPR in a statement that it is ""fully committed to upholding the highest standards of safety, quality and transparency for cosmetics and personal care products."" The group says on its website that it has ""a long history of science and safety best practices, often going beyond what is required by law."" In a 2024 statement responding to concerns about PFAS, known as ""forever chemicals,"" in personal care products, the group said that all cosmetic ingredients are subject to the same federal safety requirements, adding that ""member companies take their responsibility for product safety ... very seriously."" Consumer Reports says that the Safer Beauty Bill Package addresses gaps in federal regulation that were not addressed by MoCRA, ""including ingredient safety and transparency, which is what consumers care about most."" The legislation has been endorsed by over 150 companies and organizations , many focused on environmental and consumer health. Janet Nudelman, director of program and policy at Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, said in a statement that the bill package ""matches the new high bar for cosmetic safety established by the states"" and will help the FDA ""get some of the most toxic chemicals on the planet"" out of beauty products. ""These bills recognize that everyone deserves protection from unsafe cosmetic exposures regardless of where they live, shop, or work,"" she added. Studies have linked hair products primarily marketed toward Black women, like straighteners and relaxers, to an increased risk of certain cancers and other health risks. Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption Years of scientific research has linked toxic chemicals in hair, makeup and other personal care products to health problems including hormone disruption, respiratory issues, adverse reproductive outcomes and cancer. That's especially worrisome for Black and Latina women, whom research shows are more often exposed to dangerous ingredients like formaldehyde in nail and hair products. A Consumer Reports study published in March found cancer-causing ingredients in 100% of the 10 most popular synthetic hair products used in braids, extensions and other hairstyles popular with Black women. Another study, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters in May, found that formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing products are present not only in hair relaxers but in a wide range of beauty products that get even more regular use, including soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner and eyeliner. And a report released Thursday by Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, looking at the dangers of fragrances specifically, found that over 98% of fragrance chemicals either lack basic safety data or are classified as high or potentially high concern by scientific authorities. ""A gaping federal labeling loophole combined with a self-regulated fragrance industry allows for dozens — sometimes even hundreds — of chemicals to hide under the words, 'fragrance,' 'parfum,' 'aroma' or 'flavor' on the product labels of beauty and personal care products,"" the report reads. Consumer advocates say product safety is becoming even more urgent, as girls turn to makeup and skincare products at a younger age and breast cancer rates on the rise among women under 65. While the European Union has banned over 2,400 toxic chemicals from personal care products, the FDA only restricts about a dozen . Advocates and lawmakers want the U.S. to start catching up. ""It's time to close the loopholes that allow toxic chemicals in the products we use on our bodies every day,"" Schakowsky said. The bills have been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for consideration, the first step in the legislative process. Here's what they would do if passed: Janette Robinson Flint, co-founder and executive director of Black Women for Wellness, said in a statement that she hopes Congress will ""meet this moment with a sense of urgency."" ""Women, girls, and all people in this country deserve better from our legislators, regulatory agencies (EPA/FDA), and corporations,"" she said."
5,Health,"A poll of parents last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. Boys took it to bulk up; girls took it to replace meals. Huizeng Hu/Moment RF/Getty Images hide caption Emiliano Slesaransky, 17, joined Santa Monica High School's football team as a freshman and — at the urging of coaches and teammates— started hitting the gym whenever possible: in the morning, after school and on the weekends. The people he met there would share their strategies for bulking up. ""They would take protein powders, other supplements like some people I know take ashwagandha, and maybe creatine,"" he says, citing popular energy and exercise-enhancing supplements. Emiliano started taking some of them, too. But his dad, Eduardo Slesaransky, wanted to make sure his son's diet — and attitude — remained balanced: ""My concern was the influence that social media has on these supplements and these kinds of things and the culture of bodybuilding and the gyms."" Protein supplements are big on social media, where influencers are helping drive sales of protein bars, shakes and powders. A poll of parents by the Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. ""Teen boys were more likely — twice as likely — to consume protein every day,"" says Sarah Clark , a research scientist and co-director of the poll . Girls, she says, more often relied on supplements as meal replacements, and the inspiration to consume protein shakes, bars or powders often came from coaches, peers, or influencers on social media. But Clark says parents were also among those promoting protein to their children. ""I wonder if, as parents, we are recognizing how much messaging we have taken in about protein being good,"" she says. ""We have absorbed this messaging: That's the key to being healthy,"" she says, when in fact it is only one factor in a balanced, healthy diet. The vast majority of teens already get enough protein in their diet without supplements, pediatric dietitian Abriana Cain says. Elkhophoto/iStockphoto/Getty Images hide caption There is also such a thing as too much protein, says Abriana Cain, a pediatric dietitian with Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. As a general rule, Cain tells teens and parents to gauge protein intake based on size — benchmarked at roughly 1 gram of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. (For a 150-pound teen, that amounts to about 68 grams of protein per day — or the rough equivalent of a cup of cooked chicken, a cup of yogurt and a cup of black beans.) ""It might even increase from there, based on their physical activity needs,"" she says. Cain says more than 100 grams a day can damage the kidneys and liver in the longer term. It can also cause stomach pain, as it did for one of her patients. ""They were eating protein supplements with all of their meals and also with all of their snacks, and they were having a lot of abdominal pain."" The vast majority of teens, Cain says, already get enough protein in their diet without supplements. There are also concerns about the marketing of supplements. There is no quality control for these products, notes pediatrician and eating disorder expert Dr. Jason Nagata , at the University of California San Francisco. Supplements, including protein bars and powders, are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration in the same way as drugs — so they're not tested before going on the market, and their ingredients aren't verified before they are sold. Manufacturers are responsible for evaluating the safety and labelling of their products. The FDA does have the authority to take action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. ""I think it's important for teens and parents to know that there isn't that kind of rigorous quality control, especially when you're getting mixtures of muscle-building supplements and products,"" he says. ""I would just be very cautious."" Nagata advises researching, reading ingredient labels and buying directly from known companies. Some products have been found to have contaminants such as heavy metals, bacteria, or chemicals or adulterants not listed on the label. Separately, Nagata is concerned that the protein craze is contributing to the alarming increase in eating disorders among boys over the past two decades worldwide . He observes that over that time period, action figures like Batman and Superman are sold with bigger muscles, and pressures on ordinary teenagers to post attractive photos of themselves to be popular online have increased. ""The masculine body ideal has become increasingly large and muscular, and so more and more boys are trying to become muscular now than they have ever before,"" he says. Emiliano Slesaransky stopped using protein powders about a year ago, he says, largely because he started forgetting to take it. His father, Eduardo, says his son still looks very strong and fit, but is no longer fixated with bulking up for sports. ""He's focusing on getting into college."""
6,Health,"The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has been up and running for three years. The day after its third anniversary, the Trump administration shut down a specialized option for gay and trans young people. Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images hide caption The nation's Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, 988, shuttered the specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth this week. The move came a day after the Lifeline marked three years since its launch. During this period, it has fielded more than 16 million calls, texts and chats. Nearly 10% of those contacts have been from gay and transgender young people, according to government data . ""This is a tragic moment,"" says Mark Henson, vice president of government affairs and advocacy at The Trevor Project , one of several organizations that had contracts with the federal government to provide counseling services for this vulnerable population. The Trevor Project fields about half the LGBTQ+ contacts. Data from the Youth Behavior Risk Survey , conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, show that LGBTQ+ youth are more likely to experience persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness compared to their peers, and more likely to attempt suicide. When these young people contact 988, they have had the option to press 3 to be connected to a counselor specifically trained to support their unique mental health needs, which are associated with discrimination and violence they often face. This service is similar to what 988 offers to veterans, who are also at a higher risk of suicide, and can access support tailored for them by pressing 1 when they contact 988. That service will be retained as 988 enters its fourth year. ""Many LGBTQ+ youth who use these services didn't know they existed until they called 988 and found out there is someone on the other end of the line that knows what they've gone through and cares deeply for them,"" says Henson. Government data show that demand for this service grew steadily since it launched, from about 2,000 contacts per month in September 2022 to nearly 70,000 in recent months . The 988 Lifeline, including its services for veterans and LGBTQ+ youth, was started through bipartisan legislation signed into law by President Trump during his first term. In June, the Trump administration announced in a press release that it ""will no longer silo LGB+ youth services, also known as the 'Press 3 option,' to focus on serving all help seekers."" ""The Press 3 option has run out of congressionally directed funding,"" Danielle Bennett, a spokesperson for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, which is in charge of 988, told NPR in an email. Congress had allocated more than $33 million for the LGBTQ+ services for 2025 and the money was spent by June 2025, according to Bennett. The amount allocated for all 988 services for this year was nearly $520 million . ""Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service,"" Bennett wrote. Henson, with The Trevor Project, says the congressionally allocated money was surpassed in previous years as well, and the Biden administration reallocated more money to fund the organization based on the work they provided. ""So there was the knowledge and understanding at the beginning of the year that the congressional set aside was likely to be exceeded,"" he says. ""I believe the [current] administration has the ability, as past administrations have, to continue funding this program,"" Henson added. ""When we created the 988 hotline, we knew it was important that those calls, all of them, be answered promptly,"" says Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., who wrote the bipartisan legislation that created 988. ""Somebody in a mental health crisis, somebody contemplating suicide can't be put on hold. And so the department always had the leeway to move around resources in a way to make sure that these calls were answered in a timely and responsible way."" Ending the services for LGBTQ+ youth is a political move, says Baldwin. ""They have had relentless attacks on members of the LGBTQ community, particularly transgender individuals, transgender youth,"" she says. ""In the face of those relentless political attacks on this very vulnerable community, to then cut off a lifeline is absolutely cruel."" The Trevor Project, which has been serving the gay and trans youth community through its own lifeline well before 988 will continue to provide that support, says Henson, even though ""the loss of this federal funding means that our capacity to do so has been cut in half,"" he says. But, he adds, ""we worked with our counselors, we worked internally, we worked with allies to make sure that everyone knows that no matter what happens, the Trevor Project itself will continue to support the mental health of LGBTQ plus youth in crisis."" Such youth can go to https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-help/ to reach a trained counselor. Here are the specific ways to reach the service. – Call 1-866-488-7386 –Text ""start"" to 678-678 –Or chat from a computer ""We've asked supporters and others to help fortify our crisis services so that someone will be on the line there when the LGBTQ+youth reach out,"" he says. Even though the press 3 option is no longer available, anyone in crisis — including young people — call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to connect with a counselor."
7,Health,"Protein has taken over the packaged-snack aisles at the grocery store. But do you need extra protein in your chips and muffins? winterling/iStockphoto/Getty Images hide caption Protein has never gone out of style. While fat was demonized as the nutrient causing weight gain in the 1990s, followed by carbs in the 2000s, protein sat by the sidelines as the official people pleaser of the macro-nutrient world. ""You need essential amino acids in the diet in order to sustain life,"" says Stefan Pasiakos, director of the Center for Human Performance Optimization at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Protein is needed for building and repairing muscle and tissues and helps support your immune system. Protein stepped into the spotlight in recent years as keto and other high-protein diets took off. Health and fitness influencers started to push everyone to eat more muscle-building foods in every meal (deep-fried cottage cheese Doritos anyone?) The nutrient is so ubiquitous online that one influencer asks whether protein can leave him alone for five minutes . And it has now taken over the snack food aisles, with ""high-protein"" or ""protein-packed"" labels on the front of products as diverse as sweet rolls, chips and pretzels. There's even a high-protein version of a Snickers bar. Of course, these claims don't always mean the food is good for you or even a good source of protein. ""You'll see chips labeled high protein,"" says Pasiakos, who is a former director of the National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements. ""In reality, they're probably not, but people are now trying to jump all over it."" The global protein-snacks market alone is projected to grow from $50 billion in 2024 to $101 billion by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights . Snack-makers often market protein front and center on their packaging without mentioning the food's sugar content, says Pasiakos. For instance, a candy with 1 gram of protein may have a high-protein marketing claim on the front of the package and to the maker, ""it may not even be a false claim because they're thinking, 'If you looked at another candy, it's not going to have a gram of protein in it,'"" he says. Among many examples, Smash Foods' cashew butter and blueberry jam Snack Bites, sold at Whole Foods, advertises 5g of protein, yet it has 16g of sugar, more than triple its protein amount. 365 Chewy Protein Bites aren't much better, with various flavors having about 20g of sugar to 10g of protein. The Food and Drug Administration regulates marketing claims on packaged foods, restricting manufacturers from making big, overarching health claims without proof. For instance, companies can't claim their food prevents heart attacks or cures cancer, Pasiakos says. They also can't use the word ""healthy"" or derivatives of the word without meeting the FDA healthy standards of providing a specific amount of a nutrient within a food group. So saying something is ""high protein"" can be a way of working around the regulations while signaling to consumers that a food might be good for them. So how do you determine whether a snack making protein claims is worth eating? Pasiakos offers this simple calculation to get a sense of what share of the food's total calories is derived from protein. Take the number of grams of protein in the product and multiply it by 4 — that's the number of calories per gram of protein . Now you know the calories from protein in the food. Then take the protein calories and divide by the total calories in the food. That gives you the share of calories in the food that comes from protein. For instance, let's say a protein bar has 20 grams of protein and 200 calories. You'd multiply 20 × 4 to get 80. Then you'd divide 80 by 200 and get 40%. ""Anything that was high in protein would have 30% or more of protein by calorie count,"" says Pasiakos. Another option would be to check the percentage of the daily value (listed as DV) of protein listed on the Nutrition Facts label on the package. Anything 20% or above can be seen as high protein, according to the FDA . But even if a snack is high in protein, is it automatically healthy? Not necessarily. ""Protein's important, but it's not the only nutrient we should be looking at,"" says Clare Parme Miller, a New York-based registered dietician for Lifeways Nutrition . It's equally important to get enough of other nutrients like fiber and to avoid foods high in added sugars or highly processed ingredients. ""Look for snacks with added sugars of less than 10 grams that are less processed than most protein bars,"" she suggests. And, you may not need your snacks to be high protein, she notes. The federal government suggests adults get at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 per pound), which is 51 grams for a 140-pound woman who isn't pregnant or breastfeeding. Some nutrition and fitness experts recommend more, especially for those seeking to build muscle and for older people. So when it comes to snack time, says Parme Miller, ""especially if you're getting 20 to 30 grams of protein at mealtime, snacks only need to provide 10 to 15 grams."" (The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a handy nutrient calculator that takes into consideration your age and activity level.) It's not hard to meet protein minimums with whole foods, says Parme Miller, instead of reaching for packaged snacks with protein claims. ""Greek yogurt or small cups of cottage cheese will fulfill your protein requirement and also provide calcium,"" says Parme Miller. Add berries for a boost in fiber and antioxidants. Nuts without other added ingredients and roasted chickpeas, in single-serving sizes, provide less protein than Greek yogurt but can be paired with other items to get to 10 grams. For instance, you could add whole grain crackers to boost protein a bit and get another food group in. An ounce of cheese plus a few whole grain crackers also gives you protein and whole grains, which are high in fiber and contain calcium and several B vitamins. Other whole grain plus protein snacks include smearing a nut butter on whole grain crackers or doing the same with hummus, says Parme Miller.

8,Health,"The Texas Legislature passed a bipartisan law aimed at clarifying the emergency exception to the state's abortion ban this spring. The law is called The Life of the Mother Act. Gabriel C. Pérez/KUT News hide caption AUSTIN, Texas — Across the 18 states that have banned or tightly restricted abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , questions have persisted over when doctors can perform abortions in medical emergencies. State lawmakers out of Texas say a newly passed law called the Life of the Mother Act should clarify for doctors in the state where to draw the line. Reproductive rights advocates and medical groups are watching to see if it saves lives. In Texas , abortion is only permitted when a woman's life or one of her major bodily functions is at risk, but doctors have said it's unclear what qualifies under such emergency medical exceptions. The penalties are steep if they get it wrong: In Texas, doctors face a sentence of up to 99 years in prison, fines and the loss of their medical license. Dr. Emily Briggs is a family physician in Central Texas who says she fields a lot of questions about the ban from young doctors who train at her practice. ""We have physicians in training — medical students and residents — who are choosing not to go through their training in Texas for a multitude of reasons,"" she says. Many new doctors are worried they can't get a full education in Texas because they can't train in abortion care under the ban, Briggs says. Some are concerned about the impact of the ban on their own health as they consider starting families. That's part of why Briggs supported the new law in Texas. ""I think this is a great step in the right direction,"" she says. The new law came after years of activism by doctors and patients, as well as reporting from ProPublica that showed at least three Texas women have died after delays in care. An investigation from the outlet also found that rates of sepsis have risen among pregnant women under the state's abortion ban. A diverse coalition contributed to the writing of the bill, including medical associations and anti-abortion groups. The new clarifications: The bill was filed by Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes , the same lawmaker who authored the Texas Heartbeat Act , a six-week abortion ban that went into effect in 2021, prior to the repeal of Roe v. Wade . ""Most hospitals, most doctors, are getting this right. But this bill is to remove any excuse, remove any question, and also to make sure that doctors are trained,"" Hughes said in March. Amanda Zurawski was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that sought to clarify the emergency medical exception to Texas' abortion ban. She says the state's new law is a ""very, very, very tiny step forward."" Michael Minasi/KUT News hide caption Several states have tried to clarify their emergency exceptions in the past, both through legislative actions and rules released by state medical boards. Some, like Florida , have released lists of medical conditions that would make an abortion lawful. Kentucky passed a law this spring that listed examples of qualifying conditions, including ectopic pregnancy and excessive bleeding. But Briggs says this tactic can be limiting. ""The laundry list approach is not appropriate, because there could be a nuance,"" she says. ""What if her nuanced care is slightly different from what has been deemed appropriate by the legislation?"" Texas' new law does strengthen protections for when a doctor performs an abortion to treat a couple of specific conditions, including ectopic pregnancy and premature rupture of membranes. That's in addition to the provisions about immediacy, burden of proof and discussions among doctors and patients. What the law does not do is add any new exceptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies — a sticking point for some medical groups and reproductive rights advocates. Some, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said they would oppose any bill that kept Texas' abortion ban in place. Mary Ziegler, a law professor and abortion law expert at the University of California-Davis, says the impact of the new law may depend on how individual doctors read it. ""I think some physicians will take these clarification bills as a kind of reassurance that the state is not just kind of going to go hog wild in prosecuting physicians in emergency cases,"" she says. But Ziegler also predicts that more risk-averse doctors will feel the law doesn't offer enough clarity to offset the steep penalties that still exist. The Life of the Mother Act also requires doctors to receive medical education on the state's abortion laws. While this could be a valuable resource, Ziegler says it could also make doctors feel they are being held to an even higher standard. ""You could see physicians reading this bill and saying, I have to be even more sure this patient is in dire straits to intervene,"" she says. Women who have been affected by Texas' abortion ban are also weighing whether the law can lead to meaningful change, including Amanda Zurawski, who lost part of her reproductive system and nearly died of sepsis when she was denied prompt abortion care. She became the lead plaintiff in the high-profile Zurawski v. Texas lawsuit , which asked the courts the clarify the state's abortion ban. The court ultimately ruled it's not its role to clarify state laws. Zurawski says she sees Texas' new law as ""a very, very, very tiny step forward,"" but that the legislation ultimately does not make her feel safer. ""I can't get pregnant again, because of what the state of Texas made me go through. If I could, I would not remain in Texas for a pregnancy. There's no way,"" she says. Ziegler says it will take time to determine whether the law will prevent more cases like Zurawski's, as doctors and hospital administrators learn about the legislation and are faced with real-time medical emergencies. ""There's a kind of rubber meets the road question about whether these actually prevent tragedies or not,"" Ziegler says, ""and I think it's too early to say."""
9,Health,"Health insurance premiums are going way up next year for people who buy their insurance on Healthcare.gov or the state-based marketplaces, according to an analysis out Friday. The average person who buys Affordable Care Act insurance will be paying 75% more for their premium, according to the analysis from KFF , a nonpartisan health policy research group. Summer is the time of year when health insurance companies set their rates for the following January and then submit those rates to state regulators. Researchers at KFF then pore over those documents to make sense of what health insurance costs are going to look like for consumers in the coming year. ""These filings are usually hundreds of pages filled with math and equations,"" explains one of those researchers, Cynthia Cox . ""But sometimes they also add this narrative to explain why they're raising their premiums."" This year, instead of talking about rising drug costs or hospital charges, insurance companies were talking about federal policy, Cox says. ""Pretty much every insurance company is talking about the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits in the ACA markets."" Those markets are where people go to buy Obamacare plans, which serve people who can't get health insurance through their jobs and who don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare. The enhanced subsidies started during the COVID-19 pandemic under the Biden administration and helped dramatically decrease the cost of premiums for these plans. It turns out that people liked those lower premiums. ""The number of people signing up for coverage has more than doubled,"" says Cox, who directs the Program on the Affordable Care Act at KFF. In January, enrollment hit a record 24 million . That high enrollment helped drive the uninsured rate to its lowest level ever. Now that those subsidies are going away for next year, premiums are going to spike. For example, if someone paid $60 a month for their health insurance this year, they might be looking at $105 a month next year. People who are generally healthy might well decide that the higher premium is not worth it. They'll go without health insurance and risk it. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that letting the subsidies expire would increase the number of uninsured by 4.2 million people over the next decade. If healthy people opt out, the insurance pool is left with those who cost insurance companies more — people who can't go without health insurance because of chronic conditions or expensive medications. ""That's why insurance companies are going ahead and charging a higher premium, with the expectation that the market is going to get sicker next year,"" explains Cox. Of course, Congress could extend the enhanced subsidies, but that would mean President Trump and Republican lawmakers supporting the Affordable Care Act, which is unlikely. The Republican Study Committee's 2025 fiscal budget said the enhanced subsidies ""only perpetuate a never-ending cycle of rising premiums and federal bailouts — with taxpayers forced to foot the bill."" The chair of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., last year urged Congress to reject an extension, saying the subsidies ""hide the unsustainable skyrocketing cost of Obamacare."" Cox of KFF points out that a big portion of the new people who got covered in the last few years live in Republican strongholds . ""A lot of Southern states like Texas and Florida and Georgia have seen a tremendous amount of growth in their ACA marketplaces,"" she says. That growth could be reversed if higher premiums price people out of coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8.2 million people who get ACA insurance now will become uninsured over the next decade due to the expiration of the enhanced tax credits along with other changes that the Trump administration and Congress have made to the marketplaces through regulations and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act."

11,Health,"President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he departs the White House on Tuesday. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images hide caption President Trump has a circulatory condition known as chronic venous insufficiency, but ""remains in excellent health,"" the White House physician said in a memo on Thursday. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called this a ""common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70."" Trump is 79. Trump underwent a ""comprehensive examination"" after noticing ""mild swelling"" in his lower legs in recent weeks, the White House said. Dr. Sean Barbabella noted in his memo there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, which would be more serious conditions. It is unclear when the examination happened. Chronic venous insufficiency happens when the valves inside veins stop working properly, so blood that should flow to the heart to pick up oxygen tends to pool in the lower extremities. In the White House briefing on Thursday, Leavitt also acknowledged recent pictures of the president showing bruising on his hands, which she said was attributable to irritation from ""frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin,"" which is used to prevent cardiovascular disease. The circulatory issue was not raised in Trump's annual physical exam in April . That report said, "" blood flow to his extremities is unimpaired ."" It did note he takes aspirin for heart health, but concluded — as the memo Thursday states — that Trump ""remains in excellent health."" Chronic venous insufficiency is a disease that impedes blood from flowing freely from the legs up to the heart because of damaged veins. As a result, blood gathers in the legs, which can cause increased pressure there, and eventually lead to broken capillaries if the condition goes untreated, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Broken capillaries can cause bruising very easily, leading to reddish-brown skin in the area, as well as tissue inflammation and damage, and ulcers, the organization says. It affects up to 40% of Americans, particularly women, middle-age and elderly people, according to the Society for Vascular Surgery. ""The veins, particularly in the lower extremity, are very thin walled structures and they have valves so that when you stand up, all the blood doesn't rush to your feet, these valves close, but over time these valves can become dysfunctional,"" Dr. Niten Signh, a vascular surgeon at the University of Washington, told NPR's Will Stone. According to the Cleveland Clinic, some symptoms of the disease include: Chronic venous insufficiency is not life-threatening and does not usually require amputation. Though, it is not reversible. Venous disorders, such as deep vein thrombosis and chronic venous insufficiency, have six stages. A person who has had deep vein thrombosis is more likely to be diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. A diagnosis of CVI is given at the third stage, the Cleveland Clinic says. There are a variety of ways to treat chronic venous insufficiency, including through exercising, undergoing compression therapy, maintaining a healthy weight and taking medications, such as blood thinners, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Nonsurgical treatments are also available. Sclerotherapy involves injecting a foam or liquid into an affected vein, which causes it to disappear or collapse. Endovenous thermal ablation uses a laser to heat and shrink the affected vein. Surgical treatments include ligation and stripping, in which diseased veins are cut out. During a microincision phlebectomy, a healthcare provider makes small punctures or cuts above the veins and uses a hook to fish out problem veins, the Cleveland Clinic says. During a subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery, a medical provider clips certain veins to prevent blood from flowing through them. This can help with ulcers. In severe cases, a patient may have to undergo a vein bypass, in which a healthy vein is taken from somewhere else in the body and used to make a detour for blood to flow around unhealthy veins, the Cleveland Clinic says. The White house has not said what type of treatment, if any, Trump is receiving."
12,Health,"Maryland has enacted a law that allows special funds collected from insurers under the ACA to be used for abortion care. Jonathan Newton/For The Washington Post/Getty Images hide caption Maryland is the first state to tap into a 15-year-old fund connected to the Affordable Care Act, to help solve a more recent problem: helping pay the expenses of patients who travel to Maryland for an abortion. The law passed this spring, and went into effect on July 1. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, states like Maryland where abortion remains legal have seen an increase in abortion procedures including patients who can't get a legal abortion in their home state. Many of those patients need financial assistance for the procedure itself, or to pay for travel from other states and lodging while they recover. That financial aid is often provided by local and regional abortion funds, like the Baltimore Abortion Fund . They are nonprofits that help individuals pay for reproductive care, travel and related expenses. This story was produced in partnership with KFF Health News . But as more and more patients have traveled to Maryland, some of the abortion funds have exhausted their resources. That puts financial pressure on abortion providers in Maryland who want to serve those traveling patients, as well as uninsured or low-income Marylanders seeking the same care. Clinicians in Maryland performed about 39,000 abortions last year, a 26% increase from 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit focused on sexual health research. Maryland is now the first state in the nation to pass a law using a much-forgotten aspect of the Affordable Care Act to help fund that care. The money comes from fees paid by insurance companies who participate in the ACA marketplaces. Maryland's move represents an innovative solution for states that have opened their doors to out-of-state patients, but are grappling with the logistics and costs of the increased clinical demand in a post- Roe landscape. ""This bill is super important for Maryland, we're making sure our clinics stay open,"" said Maryland state Del. Lesley Lopez, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. ""Maryland has been a leader on a lot of reproductive bills for the past 30 years, and so in that way, this bill fits into that legacy. ""It's also nationally significant, because there's 25 or 26 other states that can take this model and run with it. We're looking for California, Illinois, New York, those bigger states that are sitting on potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to take what we've done here in Maryland and implement it there."" With abortion now restricted or illegal in 22 states, jurisdictions like Maryland have become a destination for patients from as close as neighboring West Virginia and as far as Texas. With a staff of six, the Baltimore Abortion Fund helps patients pay for bus or plane tickets, lodging in Maryland, and sometimes even meals while they travel. The fund spends about a million dollars a year on that support. Calls to its confidential helpline have increased by 50-60% every year since Roe was overturned, said Lynn McCann-Yeh, the fund's co-director. The fund disburses aid on a weekly basis, meting out funds as people call in. Often the weekly allotment is depleted after just one or two days. ""Sometimes that means that our helpline is closing within 24 to 48 hours at the start of the week, because there's just too much demand for the amount of resources that we have,"" McCann-Yeh said. ""There are many, many more dozens of callers each week that are just getting a voicemail message saying that we've run out of support."" To help, Maryland's legislature turned to a pot of money established under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Under the law, states could decide to require insurance plans sold on the ACA ""marketplaces"" to cover abortion. The plans were required to charge a minimum fee of at least $1/month on every plan bought through the marketplace. That money was then put into an account that would be used to pay when insured patients received abortion care. More than 90% of the patients at Partners in Abortion Care receive financial assistance through various abortion funds. Scott Maucione/WYPR hide caption The state accounts were necessary because of a another federal law, the Hyde amendment, that restricts the federal government from paying for abortions (except for cases involving rape, incest or serious medical risk to the patient.) Because the federal government partially subsidizes insurance plans sold through the ACA marketplaces, the commercial insurers had to use their own money to pay the monthly fee for each policyholder. ""Insurers have quietly complied with the ACA special rules resulting in these segregated accounts that have millions of dollars in them intended for abortion coverage, "" Duffy said. Over time, the accumulated fees in such accounts have outstripped the withdrawals for abortion care for women on those insurance plans. Maryland's account has grown to $25 million, and it continues to take in about $3 million each year. Maryland's new law allows the state health department to tap those funds and allocate up to $2.5 million a year in grants to the abortion funds operating in Maryland, who can then use that money for the traveling patients, low-income patients in Maryland, or those who have no insurance coverage at all. ""We know that we will be able to use those funds wisely and to make sure that we're not turning away any patient due to their inability to pay,"" said Ramsie Monk, the director of development at the Women's Health Center of Maryland, a clinic that is on the West Virginia border. Without assistance from abortion funds, many of the patients seen at clinics would not be able to pay for their care, says Dr. Diane Horvath, an OB/GYN at Partners in Abortion Care, a clinic in College Park, Maryland. Unlike some other clinics, which only offer abortion up to 16 weeks of pregnancy, Partners in Abortion Care can provide an abortion later in pregnancy. Those procedures are more complicated and more expensive. More than 90% of the patients at Partners in Abortion Care receive financial assistance through various abortion funds. ""I would say a typical patient that we see probably every week is somebody who's already got at least one child, they're working a job that doesn't offer substantial leave for medical care, it may not offer health insurance, or the insurance it offers doesn't cover abortion, particularly when they're coming from out of state and they're struggling and living paycheck to paycheck,"" Horvath said. Anti-abortion groups in Maryland opposed the bill, claiming that it forces some insurance consumers to pay for procedures they may not agree with. ""This bill uses insurance premiums from insured women to abort the children of uninsured women,"" Laura Bogley, the executive director of Maryland Right to Life, told the state legislature on March 6. ""Many of those uninsured women are non-Maryland residents who are trafficked into the state for late term abortions that are restricted by other states."" The bill's supporters deny that traveling patients are being trafficked when they are traveling of their own volition in search of health care. The law officially went into effect on July 1, and the first tranche of money must be transferred to the state health department by the fall, before they can start making grants."
13,Health,"Greg Swan, whose son Drew died as a result of a fentanyl-related substance, looks on as President Trump speaks in the East Room of the White House. The president signed the HALT Fentanyl Act, which aims to permanently classify all fentanyl-related substances as schedule I controlled substances and aid law enforcement in prosecuting trafficking and manufacturing offenses. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images North America hide caption The White House says a key national fentanyl overdose prevention grant program, currently underfunded by roughly $140 million, will eventually be fully paid for, but with a catch. The federal money allocated by Congress will now be given out ""in increments"" rather than a single annual payment. Administration officials issued a statement about the future of the Overdose Data To Action or OD2A program , run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after NPR reported on growing concerns among CDC staffers. Speaking on condition of anonymity because they fear retribution for speaking with the press without authorization, four CDC staffers said it appears the grant money would be delayed past a key Sept. 1 deadline, when the current round of funding runs out, or could disappear altogether. ""The announcement [of delays] alone could trigger layoffs and program shutdowns,"" one CDC staffer said.  ""It could really start a chain reaction that's hard to come back from."" In the statement sent late Wednesday to NPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the OD2A program is not threatened and the ""funds will continue to be disbursed in increments."" The Department of Health and Human Services sent a separate statement to NPR saying the CDC ""remains committed"" to OD2A funding because it ""directly aligns with administration priorities."" But sources inside the CDC say it's unclear how public health and addiction programs around the country will operate — hiring staff, signing contracts, and offering complex medical services — when roughly half their funding remains uncertain. ""A verbal commitment is not a contractual commitment,"" said one CDC staffer, who said the administration's system for reviewing and approving grants remains opaque.  ""This administration changes its mind a lot.  We don't even know why we only have 50 percent [of the OD2a funding] at this point."" A second CDC staffer voiced similar concern: ""All any state or local health department can spend is what's in their bank account. IOUs don't work in the public health world. They cannot assume the full amount is coming and spend accordingly."" Administration officials declined to say why they've shifted to dolling out key public health dollars in incremental payments rather than annual disbursements. They also wouldn't offer a timeline for when the remaining $140 million in OD2A funds might be sent to CDC for distribution. Desai, the White House spokesman, suggested state and local public health departments should trust Trump to follow through on overdose prevention funding because he has made fighting fentanyl a key part of his second term. ""President Trump has done more than any other president to address America's devastating fentanyl epidemic,"" Desai said, pointing to efforts to secure the border, target drug cartels and Trump's signing on Wednesday of the HALT Fentanyl Act that toughened criminal penalties for fentanyl trafficking. But CDC staffers said the Trump administration has lost trust in recent months among many state and local health officials after clawing back billions of dollars in COVID-19 related grants and withholding funds for other public health grants managed by CDC , without offering explanation as to why. Public health officials around the U.S., meanwhile, say the abrupt shift in funding for the OD2A overdose and addiction grants occurred without planning or communication, forcing some to pause future spending that relies on the federal funds. Vermont's Department of Health said there is ""a lot of uncertainty"" surrounding the funding, in a statement shared with NPR.  Vermont officials said they have been warned by the CDC that OD2A funds will be delayed and may be cut. Vermont has paused spending ""until we have more clarity about the future of this funding."" CDC staffers said they also lack internal accounting systems needed to distribute money in the incremental way described by White House officials, especially when it's unclear how grants will be reviewed or when the funds might be approved. ""Unfortunately the federal government is not nimble,"" one CDC staffer said.  ""We will put out the money we have and [state and local public health departments] will have to do what they can."""
14,Health,"A flag outside the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) headquarters in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 3. The agency was shut down on July 1; remaining programs have been transferred to the State Department. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption The Trump administration says it has a compelling reason to claw back $7.9 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress had approved prior to his taking office: evidence of what President Trump called ""billions and billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse"" that his staff had uncovered. This rescission package, which includes $1.1 billion allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, is now one step closer to approval. In a marathon session that lasted into the small hours Thursday, senators voted 51-to-48 to approve the package after introducing numerous amendments. The House, which had approved an earlier version, will now vote on the amended package. The deadline for a final decision is midnight Friday. Yet even as the administration has dismantled USAID, the primary agency for providing international aid, also pointing to waste, fraud and abuse, the rationale for this foreign aid upheaval has come under scrutiny. Paul Martin, who was the inspector general for USAID until he was fired by Trump on February 11, as well as current officials and experts who monitor aid, all say the administration has provided little to no proof to justify its actions on foreign aid -– and say they are politically motivated. ""As far as I know, never once has anybody in DOGE or in the new Administration referred to the [Inspector General] criminal allegations of fraud, waste, or abuse,"" Martin said in an interview with NPR. ""Frankly, the handful of examples I am aware of were just completely made up,"" he said, referring to President Trump's claim in January that USAID sent $100 million in condoms to the militant group Hamas in Gaza. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has publicly stated that staff at the State Department, along with DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, worked ""very long hours"" over six weeks to review 6,500 USAID programs. It was during these reviews, according to the State Department, that evidence of fraudulent expenditures, abuse and waste was uncovered. Rubio made these comments on March 10 when he announced that 83% of these programs would be terminated after the ""thorough"" review process found that the agency spent ""tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States."" NPR interviewed six officials at USAID and the State Department who had direct knowledge of what transpired. They all said that a thorough review had not been done. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The decision to terminate thousands of foreign aid programs came weeks before Rubio's announcement, the officials said, when the bulk of USAID staffers were put on administrative leave. The agency and the State Department were experiencing so much ""chaos and confusion,"" as one source put it, that a thorough investigation or review did not take place. The officials, who observed the reviews, all said that administration and DOGE staff did a ""surface level"" search for key words in the descriptions of thousands of programs, and if they found words like ""gender"" or ""family planning"", ""climate"" or ""equality"" the program was marked for termination. ""Nobody looked at the effectiveness of the programs, it was just a question of political alignment,"" one official told NPR. NPR requested clarification from the State Department on how the review process had unfolded and how thorough it was, asking about the allegations made by the officials we interviewed. The State Department responded with a statement saying that in an exhaustive process ""each program was reviewed individually"" to ensure that foreign aid ""works to make America safer, stronger and more prosperous."" In a hearing at the Senate Appropriations Committee last month, Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the rescission package cuts ""egregious examples of blatant government waste and abuse"" that his office discovered following this review of federal programs. But several of the officials who spoke to NPR said the administration had made no effort to weed out fraud and abuse at the United States Agency for International Development. The USAID officials who spoke to NPR also noted that many of the targeted programs fall into the category of lifesaving humanitarian aid that the Trump administration maintains is being preserved. That includes dozens of programs supporting services to combat diseases like HIV/AID, malaria and polio as well as those that provide food aid for malnourished children and clean water for vulnerable populations. Trump officials have made several allegations about inappropriate use of USAID money. At the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on June 25, Vought claimed that the rescission package included ""$9.3 million to advise Russian doctors on how to perform abortions and gender analysis."" Vought did not provide evidence for his claim. There is a law forbidding the use of federal funds for abortions overseas. And USAID has not operated in Russia since President Vladimir Putin expelled it in 2012. He also claimed that the $8 billion in unspent funds targeted by the rescission package included ""$35 million to address vasectomy messaging frameworks and gender dynamics in Ethiopia… $800,000 for prostitution rings in Nepal."" Vought and other officials have not offered documentation to back up their claims. NPR reached out to the Office of Management and Budget about these claims but did not immediately receive a response. The Trump administration's deletion of the USAID database and website earlier this year has added to confusion over how USAID money was spent, and which programs specifically are included in the rescission package. All government agencies have problems with waste, fraud and abuse, says Paul Martin, the former USAID inspector general. He had previously served as inspector general at NASA for over a decade. Inspectors General work to detect and prevent such issues within federal agencies. Martin, who was appointed to the position during the Biden administration, says he had seen no evidence that these issues were running rampant at the aid agency. Meanwhile, in a report Martin issued on February 10, he warned that the rapid dismantling of the agency by the Trump Administration could make it nearly impossible to monitor its $8 billion in unspent foreign aid funds for potential misuse. The report also said that hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of food and medicine were at risk of rotting or expiring after staff were blocked from delivering them because of spending freezes instituted by the Trump administration. Martin was fired the next day. No official reason was given for his ouster. ""We are all waiting for DOGE to provide information, both about money saved and about the fraud, waste and abuse that they say they found,"" said Jonathan Katz , who researches such topics as anti-corruption, democracy and international development at the Brookings Institution. Katz was a senior official at USAID under President Obama. ""There are no internal safeguards to actually hold the government accountable for fraud, waste and abuse right now in this administration, because they've removed them,"" Katz said, referring to the firing of 17 inspector generals across federal institutions. In a statement responding to NPR's request for comment, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said that there had been decades of mismanagement at USAID and that the agency "" strayed from its original mission and became a bloated, taxpayer-funded nonprofit, where unelected bureaucrats unilaterally doled out over $40 billion in taxpayer dollars every year. President Trump was elected by the American people to put America First, and he restored accountability to taxpayer dollars at USAID, State, and across the administration."" Katz and Martin say the administration is well within its rights to take a look at funding and change what it doesn't like. But they questioned the use of fraud as a justification to shut down a federal agency and cut billions of funds appropriated by Congress, emphasizing that there needs to be proof. ""It's not unusual for administrations to look at departments and agencies and scrutinize how money is being spent,"" Katz said. ""But when you are doing things in the dark of the night, when you're making unsubstantiated claims about fraud, waste and abuse you lower the trust of the American people in governance and the governing system, and that is really important. This needs to be done in a transparent and accountable way."" The question of transparency has also concerned Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine. On Tuesday, joining the Senate Democrats, she was one of three Republicans who voted no on advancing the package for a Senate vote. Vice President JD Vance had to step in on Tuesday night to cast the tie-breaking vote after Collins and two other Republican senators joined Democrats in voting against starting debate on the measure. In the final Senate vote, Collins and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski were the only two Republicans to vote against the package. ""The rescissions package has a big problem — nobody really knows what program reductions are in it. That isn't because we haven't had time to review the bill. Instead, the problem is that OMB has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process,"" Collins said in a statement. In its effort to gain approval for the rescission package, the White House agreed to remove $400 million of funding for the global HIV/Aids program PEPFAR, which is credited with having saved 25 million lives, after several Republican senators voiced concerns over cutting the popular program."

The four boys and four girls, including a set of identical twins, need to be followed longer to confirm the procedure is safe and effective, the researchers say. But the results are being hailed as a milestone in the quest to harness cutting-edge genetic technologies to enable more women to have healthy babies. ""Mitochondrial disease can be devastating for the family. It can be tragic,"" says Doug Turnbull , a professor of neurology who is part of the team at Newcastle University that has been developing the technique for more than a decade. ""This is an important breakthrough — a big step forward."" The research is thrilling many families, doctors and other scientists. ""I think this is a landmark advance. It is pioneering work,"" says Dietrich Egli , an associate professor of developmental cell biology at Columbia University who had been advocating for lifting federal restrictions on similar research in the U.S. ""It is extraordinary — no question about it."" But some critics question the approach. They worry about risks, and whether the approach will open the door to using genetic technologies to manipulate the genes in other ways to someday create ""designer babies."" Moreover, genetic changes like this can be passed down for generations. So any mistakes could introduce deleterious mutations into the human gene pool, they say. ""It's dangerous,"" says Stuart Newman , a professor of cell biology and anatomy at the New York Medical College. ""It's biologically dangerous. And then it's dangerous culturally because it's the beginning of biological manipulation that won't just end with preventing certain diseases, but will blossom into a full-fledged eugenics program where genes will be manipulated to make designer babies."" Current U.S. regulations would prevent the procedure from being used in this country to produce children. But a New York doctor reported in 2016 that he had created a three-parent baby for a Jordanian family in Mexico . Australia has legalized i t. And doctors in some other countries, including Greece and Ukraine , have used the technique to try to help infertile women have babies, even though it's unclear the method works for that purpose. ""I think it will normalize the fact that it's appropriate to take this material and to tinker with it, all in the pursuit of the perfect baby, whatever somebody happens to think that is,"" says Francois Baylis , a distinguished research professor emerita at Dalhousie University in Canada. Mitochondrial disorders can cause serious health problems, including paralysis, heart failure, brain damage, strokes and blindness. Children born with one of these disorders often live short, painful lives. The disorders are caused by defects in mitochondrial DNA. The genetic material is the blueprint for structures called mitochondria, which provide energy to cells. This DNA is passed only from mother to child. The fix tested by the British scientists is sometimes called "" mitochondrial donation ."" It involves removing the genes from the nucleus of the fertilized egg of a couple who wants to have a healthy baby. Those genes represent the majority of genetic material in eggs and are responsible for most of a person's traits, such as their appearance. The defective mitochondrial DNA is left behind. The genes from the nucleus of the egg are then injected into a fertilized egg from a healthy woman that has had all of its DNA removed except for the donor's healthy mitochondrial DNA. This is called pronuclear transfer. The resulting embryo can then develop with the healthy donor mitochondria and later be implanted into the womb of the woman who wants a healthy, genetically related baby. As a result, the baby has all the DNA responsible for the main traits of the two parents trying to have a healthy baby along with a small amount of mitochondrial DNA from the woman who donated the egg. That is why they are sometimes referred to as ""three-parent"" babies. In the new study, the babies were born to seven women at high risk of transmitting serious, disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations to their offspring. Their mother's disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations were either undetectable or present at levels that are unlikely to cause disease, the researchers reported. ""A child with one of these conditions can be in a lot of pain, suffer all sorts of problems and die. It's truly horrible to have to watch your child slowly die of something that bad. It's heartbreaking,"" says Robin Lovell-Badge , a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London who wrote an editorial accompanying the papers. ""So for women at risk of having children with serious mitochondrial diseases, this provides them with an option to have children without suffering. It's very encouraging."" ""All the children are well and continue to meet their developmental milestones,"" Newcastle University's Turnbull says. Baylis, at Dalhousie University, and others worry about risks that may not yet be apparent, to the babies themselves, the women having the babies and the women donating the eggs, such as a dangerous hyperstimulation of their ovaries. ""There are risks to the women who are going to be receiving the embryo and there are risks to the women who are the donor of the eggs that will be providing the mitochondria, Baylis says. ""We don't know the future."" She's also worried about putting so much importance on the need by couples to only have children with their own genes. ""What you're seeing is this sense that, 'My genes are very valuable. My genes are the only ones worth reproducing.' And I think that's always worth questioning,"" Baylis says. Women at risk of having children with a mitochondrial disorder have other options, including adoption, she argues. Turnbull acknowledges the research remains at a relatively early stage, requiring additional follow-up research and monitoring. ""The results so far are very encouraging,"" he says. Turnbull argues reproductive technologies are highly regulated in Britain and many other countries: ""I think there are enough checks and balances in the system to prevent this from becoming a slippery slope to designer babies."" Others stress that the technology is distinct from gene-editing techniques like CRISPR, which have also raised fears about designer babies. ""This is totally different,"" Lovell-Badge says. ""This is using a method that is avoiding a serious disease. If you care about peoples' health, peoples' desire to have genetically related children, then I see no reason why you should not accept these methods."""
16,Health,"Ragpickers search for recyclable materials like metal and plastic at a dumping ground near Ahmedabad, India, which they'll sell to scrap traders. Working conditions are brutal during severe heat. A new program administered by the Self Employed Women's Association, a trade union, offers a payout for days missed when the temperature hits a certain threshold so the ragpickers can stay home and protect their health without losing income. Sam Panthaky/AFP/via Getty Images hide caption On sweltering summer mornings, Laxmiben Nadia leaves her shanty by 8 a.m. to collect waste in the Vatva neighborhood of Ahmedabad, one of the hottest cities in western India's state of Gujarat. Draping her sari so she can cover her face and protect herself from the putrid smell of the rubbish mound, Nadia, who's 57, sorts through the massive waste garbage dump, stretching over 6 miles on the city's outskirts, to earn a living for her family of five. There are over 50,000 waste pickers like her in Ahmedabad — and nearly 1.5 million in India. One day last summer, just past 9 a.m. Nadia had completed one round, collecting plastic and discarded metals that she typically sells to scrap traders for about $4. Though sweating profusely, she contemplated another round but suddenly fell to the ground. Laxmiben Nadia earns her living by collecting plastic and metal from trash dumps to sell to scrap dealers. Last summer, she collapsed while working during extreme heat and needed a week to recover. She benefited from a program administered by the Self Employed Women's Association, a trade union, offering cash payouts to workers who stay home when temperatures hit a certain threshold. Above: Nadia visits the union's offices. Jyoti Thakur for NPR hide caption ""I did not realize what happened to me as I laid there for around 20 minutes and was unable to get up,"" recalls Nadia, who is from India's historically and socially marginalized Dalit caste (formerly known as ""untouchables""). Her fellow waste pickers hurriedly arranged for a motorized rickshaw to take her to a small government clinic, where the doctor informed that she had suffered temporary paralysis due to the heat. This wasn't the first time Nadia had suffered ill effects from heat. But this incident had a different outcome. After treatment for heat stroke, which cost less than a dollar, she lost a week of work while recovering. But she didn't panic about paying her bills. She received $14 in two installments through a newly instituted parametric heat insurance program. The word parameter refers to a measurable event — in this instance, a certain temperature — that would trigger a payout to replace income lost by daily wage workers who stay home to protect their health during extreme heat. That's a critical benefit in India, which is seeing record-breaking heat waves linked to climate change. Last year, several Indian cities recorded a staggering 52.3°C (126°F), resulting in over 48,000 cases of heat stroke and 161 deaths, according to official data — a figure scientists believe is significantly underreported. Parametric insurance programs are being introduced and gaining ground in India, offering financial protection for climate-linked losses — ranging from income lost by daily wage workers during heatwaves to reduced earnings from farmers because of heat-stressed livestock (which produce less milk and are less fertile and more disease prone) and damage to crops caused by excessive rainfall. Laxmiben Nadia, who salvages plastic and metal from a trash dump to enter a living, received a cash payout after she lost work days due to heat stroke — enabling her to ""manage my daily expenses when I needed to rest."" It's part of a program administered by her union, the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA). Above; Nadia (left) speaks to a SEWA staffer in the union's office. Jyoti Thakur for NPR hide caption The insurance program that came to Nadia's aid is a collaboration between the Ahmedabad-based Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) — a trade union of over 3 million informal women workers — and the nonprofit , which provides technical expertise and co-funding for the insurance program. Piloted in 2023 across 22 districts, including Ahmedabad, the program now covers 50,000 SEWA members who voluntarily enroll and pay $3.50 as part of the annual premium. The remaining cost of the insurance premium for each worker — about $4.73 — is covered by Climate Resilience for All. The premium payments go to the Indian insurance company ICICI Lombard, who handles local delivery of payouts — and to global insurance provider Swiss Re, which covers part of the payout in case of large claims. These payouts are triggered based on region-specific temperature thresholds. In Ahmedabad, for example, members receive $8.78 if daytime temperature exceeds 43.6°C (or 110.48 F) for two consecutive days, and $14.63 if it crosses 44.1°C (111.38 F) for two days in a row. Members get one payout for each qualifying heatwave, regardless of whether they keep working or suffer any direct loss. In 2024, the program disbursed around $350,859 to enrolled SEWA members. Most payments are processed within six to eight weeks of the heat threshold being met. ""I used the insurance money to set up a small food cart in the evenings, where I sold boiled eggs and omelets with bread,"" Nadia says cheerfully. While the income was modest, she was able to earn a dollar or two each night. Pankaj Tomar, India Head of AXA Climate — a division of the French multinational insurance company AXA Group — says parametric insurance offers an accessible safety net for informal workers facing climate related risks like extreme heat and floods. Tomar is not affiliated with this program. Unlike traditional indemnity insurance, which only pays out when sickness is proven through medical documentation, parametric insurance doesn't require filing a claim. Instead, it offers automatic payouts when specific thresholds, such as a certain temperature or rainfall level, are crossed. ""Most health insurance policies don't cover the kinds of health risks informal workers face, especially those caused by climate change,"" says Tomar. ""Parametric insurance is unique because it's designed to respond to climate-related health hazards, which traditional policies fail to cover. What sets it apart is that people don't need to prove their losses or fill out tedious paperwork, and they can use the payout however they want,"" he adds. The record-breaking heat waves have heightened the risk of income loss, poor crop yields and an increase in vector-borne diseases for 90% of India's population, according to a PLOS Climate study published in April 2023. ""The idea of compensating for lost work hours due to heat is highly effective in countries like India, which has a large population of gig workers and daily wage laborers who are forced to either work in hazardous conditions or go hungry,"" says Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading. There are also parametric insurance programs like the U.N. Capital Development Fund for cyclone affected countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, and Fiji. In India's flood-prone northeastern state, Nagaland was the first to insure its entire population, against heavy rainfall through parametric insurance in 2020. Called the Disaster Risk Transfer Parametric Insurance Solution (DRTPS), it disbursed over $117,000 in March this year to residents affected by the 2024 monsoon. When it comes to either rain or heat, the threshold set for payouts is critical. When SEWA piloted its parametric insurance scheme in 2023: the temperature threshold set for payouts was too high, so even on extremely hot days, the women covered didn't receive compensation. ""Now we have adjusted it to a more appropriate range,"" says Anisha Baghban, SEWA's secretary. For 40-year-old Shobha Ben Bimabhai, another member of SEWA, the insurance payout for extreme heat allowed her to do something she hadn't done in 30 years: Close her home decor shop for a couple of days — she runs it from an outdoor wooden pushcart where she stands in direct sunlight for hours. ""This summer was unbearably hot, and even customer footfall decreases on hot days,"" Bimabhai says. Because authorities don't allow vendors like her to stay open after dark, she has no way to shift her work to cooler hours. ""Regardless of the weather, I had to go to work, but this time, I took two days off,"" she says, adding, ""I used the money to pay for my daughter's one month school fee and buy her a few books."" Shobha Ben Bimabhai shows one of the decorative pieces she sells from her outdoor pushcart. She was able to stay home for a few days when temperatures soared above 100 degrees F without losing income as a result of her union's insurance program, offering payouts during extreme heat. Jyoti Thakur for NPR hide caption Baghban says that the insurance program has helped thousands of women, like Nadia and Bimabhai avoid exploitative situations, such as taking out loans with punitive repayment plans because of income loss during extreme weather. ""Our goal is to ensure that daily wage working women also lead a life with dignity,"" she adds. Despite its current success, Deoras, the research scientist, argues that parametric insurance should not be the only source of support for gig workers facing extreme weather. He emphasizes the need for government-led risk reduction measures: shaded public rest areas, improved access to drinking water and early warning systems to alert people to potentially risky levels of heat. ""The insurance program should also be expanded to cover other climate-related threats, like drought and air pollution, as climate risks grow,"" he adds. Baghban agrees. ""We are planning to propose the scheme to the state government because the challenge now is to scale the initiative to other regions, and that will be difficult without government support,"" she says. ""I never thought an insurance scheme could be for someone like me,"" says Nadia, adding that with her limited income, traditional health insurance has always seemed too expensive. Now, she says, the parametric plan, ""even for a short while, helped me manage my daily expenses when I needed to rest."" Jyoti Thakur is a freelance journalist based in New Delhi, India.

17,Health,"Even healthy brains slow down as they age. But there are ways to keep that thinker in tip-top shape. OsakaWayne Studios/Getty Images hide caption After about age 40, our brains begin to lose a step or two. Each year, our reaction time slows by a few thousandths of a second. We're also less able to recall items on a shopping list. Those changes can be signs of a disease, like Alzheimer's. But usually, they're not. ""Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people,"" says Matt Huentelman , a professor at TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in Phoenix. Huentelman should know. He helps run MindCrowd , a free online cognitive test that has been taken by more than 700,000 adults. About a thousand of those people had test scores indicating that their brain was ""exceptional,"" meaning they performed like a person 30 years younger on tests of memory and processing speed. Genetics played a role, of course. But Huentelman and a team of researchers have been focusing on other differences. ""We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing,"" he says. Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Other measures include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting plenty of exercise. Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the McKnight Brain Research Foundation , which funds studies on age-related cognitive decline and memory loss. To preserve cognitive function in later life, ""we're going to have to understand [brain] aging at a mechanistic level,"" says Alice Luo Clayton , a neuroscientist who is the group's chief executive officer. Another speaker was Christian Agudelo , a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami's Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute. ""I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids,"" Agudelo says. Those kids are 4 and 6 now, so Agudelo is getting more sleep. But his own experience is consistent with his research on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline. ""The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be both structurally and functionally,"" Agudelo says. Keep in mind: Better sleep isn't just about getting more sleep. The key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the sleep stages , Agudelo says. Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brain wave patterns. But people usually know when they've had a good night's rest, Agudelo says. ""You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile,"" he says. ""You feel refreshed."" Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky. But people can improve the odds with certain behaviors, Agudelo says ""Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun"" can lead to better sleep, he says. So can ""being active, both socially and physically."" Those behaviors increase ""sleep pressure,"" the body's natural desire to sleep the longer we are awake, Agudelo says. When that pressure is high, he says, ""we can fall asleep more easily and deeply."" Brain aging is also influenced by vascular risk factors, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes, says Charles DeCarli , a neurologist who co-directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Davis. People know that these risk factors usually contribute to medical conditions like heart attack or stroke, DeCarli says. But research on thousands of people 65 and older has found that these risk factors can also impact the brain directly — even if they don't cause a heart attack or other cardiovascular problems. ""The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than in people who do not have them,"" he says. So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system. ""The question is, if you have these diseases and they are well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain?"" he says. ""And the answer seems to be yes."""
18,Health,"An anti-fentanyl sign in Leavenworth, Kansas. Kansas is one of 49 states that face funding delays for a key federal grant program used in the fight against fentanyl overdoses. Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images hide caption The Trump administration has delayed and may cancel roughly $140 million in grants to fund fentanyl overdose response efforts, according to four staff members with close knowledge of the process at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The staffers shared detailed information with NPR about the funding disruption and potential cuts on the condition of anonymity, saying they don't have permission to speak publicly about their concerns and feared retribution from the Trump administration if identified. ""These are lives at stake,"" said one CDC staffer, who has a role administering the addiction grant program, known as the Overdose Data To Action program, often referred to as OD2A . ""The announcement [of delays] alone could trigger layoffs and program shutdowns. It could really start a chain reaction that's hard to come back from,"" the CDC staffer said. State and local public health departments fighting to lower overdose deaths from fentanyl, methamphetamines and other drugs across the U.S. describe the funds as crucial to their efforts. The last time a major national interruption of addiction care occurred, during the COVID-19 pandemic, drug deaths soared. ""[OD2A funding has] been a critical piece of the decreases we've seen in overdose deaths,"" said Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, an organization that includes 35 urban public health departments. ""Any changes to funding levels would be catastrophic and would really send us backwards,"" she said. The money currently being withheld accounts for roughly half of the funds allocated by Congress for the OD2A program, which supports fentanyl response efforts in 49 states, the District of Columbia, as well as dozens of city, county and territorial public health departments. NPR sent requests for comment about the potential OD2A cuts to the CDC, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the White House Office of National Drug Policy. Trump administration officials haven't responded. The CDC staffers said it appears the funding interruption is being caused by bureaucratic confusion involving the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cost-cutting effort and the Office of Management and Budget, which are both scrutinizing OD2A grants before money is issued. ""This is what happens when you start doing these things slash and burn,"" said the CDC employee interviewed by NPR. A second CDC staffer shared detailed notes taken during a meeting on July 10 where CDC leadership voiced uncertainty about future funding for OD2A. ""We can't promise all the funds will come,"" CDC leaders said, according to the contemporaneous notes. ""It's a procedural issue creating a real problem for jurisdictions to be able to implement the program."" Two other CDC staffers who also spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the funding delay to NPR and echoed alarm that the grant review process could lead to the funds being withheld altogether. According to public health officials around the U.S., many addiction and drug overdose programs will reach the end of their current OD2A funding cycle by Sept. 1. Without the promise of new funding, many public health departments grappling with the deadly opioid-fentanyl crisis say they've already paused new spending. With the deadline looming, Vermont's Department of Health said there was still ""a lot of uncertainty"" surrounding the funding in a statement shared with NPR. The statement said Vermont officials have been warned by the CDC that OD2A funds will be delayed and may be cut.  Vermont has paused spending ""until we have more clarity about the future of this funding."" Under the Biden administration, Congress and the federal government responded to escalating fentanyl deaths by ramping up spending on drug treatment and addiction health, including an expansion of the OD2A program . Most experts believe that bipartisan effort contributed to a dramatic decline in overdose deaths that began in 2023. The latest provisional data from the CDC found roughly 82,000 drug deaths in the 12-month period ending in January.  In August 2023, at the peak of the fentanyl crisis, the 12-month report found more than 114,000 fatal overdoses. Many public health experts told NPR that they worry the Trump administration's actions could unravel the nation's newly expanded drug treatment safety net at a moment when it was helping bring the fentanyl toll down. Three of the four CDC sources who spoke with NPR said the grant disruption could also cripple federally funded state and local surveillance systems created to detect new toxic and highly addictive substances turning up in the illicit street drug supply. Keith Humphreys, a drug policy researcher at Stanford University, said defunding street drug monitoring programs around the country would put the public at risk. ""We're just increasingly putting ourselves in the dark,"" Humphreys said. ""The drug supply is always changing. If public health officials don't know what's in the drugs, they can't warn the public."" Humphreys noted that the Trump team already laid off a team of researchers who had tracked drug use by Americans for 50 years , collecting data that many front-line addiction care providers viewed as vital. According to Humphreys, the Trump administration has made a series of moves that threaten the broader addiction care system, including mass layoffs of federal addiction researchers and the pending dissolution of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . ""We're cutting into muscle and bone,"" Humphreys said. ""The question on the front lines is how do I get naloxone out there? How do I get people into treatment? We're getting increasingly desperate as each additional program is axed."" Naloxone, also known as Narcan, is a medication that reverses opioid overdoses. It became more widely available following regulatory and funding changes implemented by the Biden administration. The interruption of OD2A funding also follows passage earlier this month of President Trump's spending plan that includes deep cuts to Medicaid , the government insurance program that funds most alcohol and drug addiction treatment in the U.S. Research published in early July estimated that as many as 156,000 people in the U.S. addicted to fentanyl and other opioids could lose access to highly effective medical treatments such as methadone and suboxone. ""What the simulation projected out is based on the loss of [insurance] coverage we would see approximately 1,000 extra [fatal overdoses per year] amongst the folks who lose access to care,"" said Dr. Benjamin Linas, a physician and addiction researcher at Boston University who co-authored the study. ""It just feels like we're throwing in the towel exactly when we were beginning to make progress,"" he said. Some public health departments signaled hope the OD2A dollars will arrive in time. ""CDC leadership warned [us] of potential cuts or delays to OD2A funding in a grant recipient meeting last week,"" Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, Boston's commissioner of public health, said in a statement to NPR. ""We have not received formal notice but are assessing potential impact."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta. Ben Hendren/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption All the CDC staffers interviewed by NPR said the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have signaled broad policy support for overdose prevention programs funded through the OD2A grant program. But they said an increasingly opaque budget review process involving the CDC, HHS, OMB and DOGE has bogged down the grant-making process. Notes shared from the July 10 meeting show CDC leadership voicing confusion over the ""criteria"" used by DOGE to review the grants and over the broader role played by DOGE staffers. ""We have no idea what it is they are looking for,"" one of the CDC staffers told NPR. Asked whether there is confidence within the CDC that the DOGE team has the medical knowledge and expertise needed to evaluate these grant programs in a timely fashion, the CDC staffer said, ""Absolutely not."""

20,Health,"Medical plan cards are seen in Portland, Ore. A federal judge this past week overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have removed medical bills from credit reports and prevented lenders from making decisions based on that medical information. Jenny Kane/AP hide caption A federal judge has ruled that medical debt can remain on Americans' credit reports, canceling a policy set in place by the Biden administration to help relieve the burden of health care expenses weighing on nearly a third of the population. The ruling — handed down by U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District Judge Sean Jordan on Friday — was a major blow to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has fought against medical debt as a metric of credit worthiness. In the waning days of the Biden administration in January, the federal banking and financial services watchdog introduced a rule to disallow medical debts from appearing on American credit reports in an effort to keep that information from influencing lenders that consider medical expenses to assess borrowers' merit. ""People who get sick shouldn't have their financial future upended,"" then-CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said at the time . ""The CFPB's final rule will close a special carveout that has allowed debt collectors to abuse the credit reporting system to coerce people into paying medical bills they may not even owe."" Credit scores factor into a person's ability to rent or buy a home, secure a car loan and other major financial decisions that can determine one's socioeconomic footing. In its January order, the CFPB cited its 2014 research , which found that medical debt was not a good indicator as to whether a borrower would default on loans, and therefore was not a necessary inclusion on credit reports. But Cornerstone Credit Union League, which brought suit against the agency that same month, argued that the CFPB's order had exceeded the independent agency's authority. Judge Jordan agreed, writing in his decision last week that every major ""substantive provision of the Medical Debt Rule"" had breached the reach of the CFPB's jurisdiction. Following Jordan's ruling, certain advocacy groups decried the move as a blow to the millions who carry medical debt. ""This ruling is a disappointing setback — but it will not stop the growing movement to protect people from the financial harm of medical debt,"" Colin Reusch, policy director at Community Catalyst, a nonprofit that advocates for health care affordability , said in a statement. ""A court sided with corporate profiteers, rather than the public."" But the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), a trade association representing some of the nation's major credit bureaus, said the judge's ruling will help protect lenders against granting loans to borrowers unlikely to make good on their debts. ""America's financial system is the best in the world because it is based on a full, fair and accurate credit reporting system,"" CDIA President and CEO Dan Smith said in a statement to NPR. ""Information about unpaid medical debts is an important element in assessing a consumer's ability to pay. This is the right outcome for protecting the integrity of the system."" An estimated 100 million U.S. citizens carry health care debt, according to an investigation by Kaiser Health News and NPR , creating a problem that is uniquely American . Those with high health care debts are at risk of homelessness and other hardship. More than a dozen states have introduced laws to keep medical debt from affecting U.S. consumers' credit, but the topic remains controversial. Congressional Republicans have denounced the CFPB's attempts to erase medical debt from credit reports. And onetime Trump ally and former Department of Government Efficiency orchestrator Elon Musk has called for the elimination of the agency altogether. ""Delete CFPB,"" he wrote in a post on X last year."
21,Health,"A research project run by the Department of Veterans Affairs that analyzes genetic data has led to medical breakthroughs.  Yet critical steps to keep the research going are stalled out. Billy Schuerman/Virginian Pilot/Tribune News Service/Getty Images hide caption One of the world's biggest genetic databases comprises DNA data donated over the years by more than a million retired military service members. It's part of a project run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The initiative, dubbed the Million Veteran Program, is a ""crown jewel of the country,"" said David Shulkin, a physician who served as VA secretary during the first Trump administration. Data from the project has contributed to research on the genetics of anxiety and peripheral artery disease, for instance, and has resulted in hundreds of published papers. Researchers say the repository has the potential to help answer health questions not only specific to veterans — like who is most vulnerable to post-service mental health issues, or why they seem more prone to cancer — but also relevant to the nation as a whole. ""When the VA does research, it helps veterans, but it helps all Americans,"" Shulkin said in an interview. Researchers now say they fear the program is in limbo, jeopardizing the years of work it took to gather the veterans' genetic data and other information, like surveys and blood samples. ""There's sort of this cone of silence,"" said Amy Justice, a Yale epidemiologist with a VA appointment as a staff physician. ""We've got to make sure this survives."" Genetic data is enormously complex, and analyzing it requires vast computing power that VA doesn't possess. Instead, it has relied on a partnership with the Energy Department, which provides its supercomputers for research purposes. In late April, VA Secretary Doug Collins disclosed to Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, that agreements authorizing use of the computers for the genomics project remained unsigned, with some expiring in September, according to materials shared with KFF Health News by congressional Democrats. Spokespeople for the two agencies did not reply to multiple requests for comment. Other current and former employees within the agencies — who asked not to be identified, for fear of reprisal from the Trump administration — said they don't know whether the critical agreements will be renewed. One researcher called computing ""a key ingredient"" to major advances in health research, such as the discovery of new drugs. The agreement with the Energy Department ""should be extended for the next 10 years,"" the researcher said. The uncertainty has caused ""incremental"" damage, Justice said, pointing to some Million Veteran Program grants that have lapsed. As the year progresses, she predicted, ""people are going to be feeling it a lot."" Because of their military experience, maintaining veterans' health poses different challenges compared with caring for civilians. The program's examinations of genetic and clinical data allow researchers to investigate questions that have bedeviled veterans for years. As examples, Shulkin cited ""how we might be able to better diagnose earlier and start thinking about effective treatments for these toxic exposures"" — such as to burn pits used to dispose of trash at military outposts overseas — as well as predispositions to post-traumatic stress disorder. ""The rest of the research community isn't likely to focus specifically"" on veterans, he said. The VA community, however, has delivered discoveries of importance to the world: Three VA researchers have won Nobel Prizes, and the agency created the first pacemaker. Its efforts also helped ignite the boom in GLP-1 weight loss drugs. Yet turbulence has been felt throughout VA's research enterprise. Like other government scientific agencies, it's been buffeted by layoffs, contract cuts, and canceled research. ""There are planned trials that have not started, there are ongoing trials that have been stopped, and there are trials that have fallen apart due to staff layoffs — yes or no?"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressing Collins in a May hearing of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. The agency, which has a budget of roughly $1 billion for its research arm this fiscal year, has slashed infrastructure that supports scientific inquiry, according to documents shared with KFF Health News by Senate Democrats on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It has canceled at least 37 research-related contracts, including for genomic sequencing and for library and biostatistics services. The department has separately canceled four contracts for cancer registries for veterans, creating potential gaps in the nation's statistics. Job worries also consume many scientists at the VA. According to agency estimates in May, about 4,000 of its workers are on term limits, with contracts that expire after certain periods. Many of these individuals worked not only for the VA's research groups but also with clinical teams or local medical centers. When the new leaders first entered the agency, they instituted a hiring freeze, current and former VA researchers told KFF Health News. That prevented the agency's research offices from renewing contracts for their scientists and support staff, which in previous years had frequently been a pro forma step. Some of those individuals who had been around for decades haven't been rehired, one former researcher told KFF Health News. The freeze and the uncertainty around it led to people simply departing the agency, a current VA researcher said. The losses, the individual said, include some people who ""had years of experience and expertise that can't be replaced."" Preserving jobs — or some jobs — has been a congressional focus. In May, after inquiries from Sen. Jerry Moran, the Republican who chairs the Veterans' Affairs Committee, about staffing for agency research and the Million Veteran Program, Collins wrote in a letter that he was extending the terms of research employees for 90 days and developing exemptions to the hiring freeze for the genomics project and other research initiatives. Holding jobs is one thing — doing them is another. In June, at the annual research meeting of AcademyHealth — an organization of researchers, policymakers, and others who study how U.S. health care is delivered — some VA researchers were unable to deliver a presentation touching on psychedelics and mental health disparities and another on discrimination against LGBTQ+ patients, Aaron Carroll, the organization's president, told KFF Health News. At that conference, reflecting a trend across the federal government, researchers from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality also dropped out of presenting. ""This drop in federal participation is deeply concerning, not only for our community of researchers and practitioners but for the public, who rely on transparency, collaboration, and evidence-based policy grounded in rigorous science,"" Carroll said. KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF ."
22,Health,"When writer Melissa Febos was 35, she decided to temporarily give up sex. ""I was coming off a devastating relationship where I had become so obsessive. I had gone completely off the rails,"" she says. She was so focused on her partner that she neglected her health, work and friendships. After a few brief entanglements, Febos opted to take a break from dating and sex. She'd been in consecutive relationships since she was 15 and hoped a period of celibacy would help her develop a more ""honest and authentic relationship to sex with other people,"" she says. Febos chronicles her year of abstinence in a new book published in June, The Dry Season: A Memoir of Pleasure in a Year Without Sex . That period helped her realize that ""I had given a tremendous amount of energy to sex and love,"" she says. ""When I withdrew that energy, I had it for myself."" Melissa Febos is the author of the memoir The Dry Season: A Memoir of Pleasure in a Year Without Sex . Left: Photograph by Beowulf Sheehan. Right: Knopf. hide caption Febos, a professor at the University of Iowa and author of Body Work , Girlhood and Whip Smart , talked to Life Kit about the surprising gifts of celibacy. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. At first, I defined my celibacy as no sex. But swiftly I realized I needed to divest from all activities surrounding sex and love: dating, flirting and maintaining sexually charged friendships. If I wanted to really go on a hiatus and be alone with myself, I needed to stop the compelling distractions that had occupied me so powerfully. I considered giving up masturbation. But upon reflection, I understood it was actually one of the most unselfconscious ways I experienced intimacy. That was as long as I could imagine not having sex, and I was trying to work with myself. I also chose it because I'm sober, and 90 days is a familiar unit of time in some recovery circles. It's generally thought of as the period of time necessary to get some breathing room from a compulsive or addictive behavior. I don't identify as a sex or love addict, but I knew there was a compulsive element to my behavior in those areas. At three months, I knew it had not been long enough to fundamentally change my behavior, so I extended it. I ended up continuing for about a year in total. Honestly, I didn't really. At 35, I was starved for alone time. I had never known how to ask for it or even recognize that need. I had been so focused on others that keeping my attention for myself was glorious. I also became aware that I often had sex when I didn't really want to, even if my partners didn't pressure me. There was an internal pressure to have sex a certain amount, because that's what a healthy relationship was made of. Also, it seemed easier to have sex I felt ambivalent about than to disappoint my partner. This now sounds unhinged to me, though I have talked to many people who feel the same way. It showed me what I had to be accountable for and how I'd been complicit in every romantic disaster of my life. I devised a list of questions that I would answer about each partner: Where was I dishonest? How was I self-centered? What happened here? It was basically a study of my past to see what I had been doing and how I could do it differently. I had so much more energy for everything else I loved. I was more politically active. My creative practice was thriving. I was spending more time with friends and family. I was going out dancing, more often than any other year of my life. I started to learn things about myself. Like, I had no idea how much alone time I needed to be happy and that sometimes I like to eat dinner at 11 p.m. Maybe the most outstanding thing was that I developed this spiritual sense of being in the world that I had relegated to my love life. I realized that I could experience it in nature, or with myself, or through art, or friendship, or all the other kinds of intimacy that are available to us. It's funny because when you say the words ""celibacy"" or ""abstinence,"" you think about lack. You think about withholding. But when I withdrew from sex, everything else became so much more sensual. It was like my sensual and erotic capacity became expressed in so many other places. I did. I've now been with my partner for eight years, married for four, and I would never have been able to sustain this relationship had I not spent that year celibate. I have been much more honest in this relationship about who I am and what I need. It's a connection beyond anything I've ever experienced. You know, I'm not big into prescription. I'm not trying to start a celibacy movement. But what I will say is that we don't know what will happen if we make a decision to try something different. I could never have foreseen how [doing that] would change the entire course of my life. The producer of this episode is Margaret Cirino. This story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

23,Health,"Megan and Stephen Alger, photographed at home with their children in Augusta, Georgia. They have eight children and are expecting their ninth in December. Kendrick Brinson/for NPR hide caption With eight kids and another one on the way, Megan Alger can seem more like the CEO of a small company than a typical American mom. In their family's suburban home in Augusta, Ga., kids are taught to be self-sufficient from a young age . Megan regularly deputizes her older children to care for the younger ones. ""I just gave my 2-year-old to my 8-year-old and said, 'Go put him in his bed,'"" she says around nap time, laughing. ""We'll see if it works."" The 8-year-old obediently carried his brother to his crib and shut the door. As Roman Catholics, Megan and her husband, Stephen Alger, believe strongly in the family unit. Megan doesn't engage in paid work in order to homeschool the younger kids and run the household. She has delivered most of her babies at home. That's the plan with this next one too. In many ways, they appear to be exactly the kind of people whom President Trump has in mind in his call for large families — the movement known as pronatalism . The administration has floated ideas like baby bonuses , increased access to in vitro fertilization and tax breaks to encourage people to have more children. The Algers' younger children ready to play in a playroom at their home on June 28. Kendrick Brinson/for NPR hide caption At the same time, a growing number of Americans distrust medical institutions — where most babies are born. And families like the Algers, as well as advocates for maternal health, say the federal government could do a lot more to support parents, starting with birth. "" I feel that for a country that's taking on this almost pro-life stance and pro-baby, and you want to have the nuclear family, we're not really doing much to increase the safety of that,"" says Katie Chubb, a community organizer who has been trying for years to give families in Augusta more options when it comes to where they have their babies. ""We're not doing much for mothers and birth safety ."" The Algers say there was a time when they were willing to vaccinate their children. But they wanted to do it on a slower schedule, and the school that their son was attending wasn't cooperating. ""We were constantly in the office with school administration,"" says Stephen, ""because somebody else had found out that 'the Algers weren't vaccinated' and were throwing a fit."" Feeling ostracized, they left — and decided to forgo vaccines all together. Seated at the table, three of the Algers' older children, Tybalt, Aurora and Dimitry (right), play a game, while the eldest, Aiden, plays the piano in their home on June 28. Kendrick Brinson/for NPR hide caption Though only Megan voted for Trump in 2024 — Stephen says he didn't like either candidate — they both felt hopeful when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed secretary of health and human services. His skepticism about vaccines and America's food system, they say, has offered some cultural legitimacy to their point of view. "" I'm not looked at as much like I'm crazy when I don't let the kids have red dye or high fructose corn syrup at the birthday party,"" says Megan. Their skepticism has also led them to a deep distrust of hospitals. And they are not alone. One study shows that trust in doctors and hospitals declined by 30 percentage points between 2020 and 2024. Megan, who grew up in a military family with five siblings, says she watched her own mother be mistreated at a hospital. Stephen points to Georgia's high rate of maternal mortality as another reason he doesn't trust the system. For every 100,000 live births, 33.9 resulted in death in that state, according to a 2018-2021 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's well above the national maternal mortality rate of 23.5 deaths per 100,000, according to the same report. The Algers' youngest child, Sven, cuddles his mother at their home on June 28. Kendrick Brinson/for NPR hide caption ""I'm a logical guy,"" says Stephen. ""If you're telling me that hospital intervention is the thing that's supposed to decrease the maternal mortality rate, why is the maternal mortality rate increasing as women adopt more common medical practices to having children?"" The Algers have had most of their babies at home with a midwife who is licensed in another state, but not in Georgia. That's the plan with this next one as well. ""Something tragic could happen,"" says Stephen. "" I acknowledge this is a risk we are accepting in order to get the benefits from having the baby at home."" Dimitry plays with his youngest brother, Sven, at their home. Kendrick Brinson/for NPR hide caption The Algers fear that in a hospital they would be pushed into interventions they don't want, in the interest of speeding up labor or making things more convenient for doctors. To be clear, data shows hospitals are safer than home birth — even in states with high rates of maternal and infant mortality — for both mothers and babies. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says the risk of a baby dying in a home birth is twice that of hospital birth . For years, advocates across the United States have been warning that the country is not doing enough to provide for America's moms and babies. They point to high rates of maternal and infant mortality despite high health care spending . In 2023, Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin was one of several legislators to introduce the Perinatal Workforce Act . She and other Democratic lawmakers aimed to improve the perinatal health workforce with diverse kinds of credentialing for health care workers involved in births. Her state has one of the highest rates of infant mortality, especially for Black women . In addition, the Biden administration outlined an ambitious plan called the Maternal Health Blueprint in 2022. Its priorities included ""ensuring women's voices are heard in the healthcare system"" and ""expanding the perinatal workforce"" — birth workers including doulas, midwives and specialized nurses. But advocates say that under the Trump administration, much of their advocacy for increased investment in maternal and child health outcomes is on hold. The Perinatal Workforce Act did not pass. It's not illegal to give birth at home in Georgia. But it's difficult. And advocates say it would be safer if there were more licensed midwives. Unlike some other states, Georgia does not license midwives who haven't first been trained as nurses. Those who have been trained and licensed, called certified nurse midwives, can be difficult to find and hire, especially in rural areas. Stephen Alger shows a photo to their youngest son, Sven, on the day he was born at their home. Kendrick Brinson/For NPR hide caption The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) offers a cautious endorsement of other kinds of training for midwives. ACOG acknowledges that there are not enough qualified people to deliver babies but says that bringing a life into the world is dangerous and requires standards and training. It's a problem that's getting worse as rural hospitals close . In Georgia, this legal landscape has given rise to a gray market for midwives. Adjgiwa is a midwife who has never received formal training. She asked to be identified only by her middle name, for fear of drawing the attention of local health authorities. Sitting in a rocking chair on her front porch in the Georgia heat one afternoon, she says she no longer knows how many babies she has delivered in her 45 years as a midwife. ""I stopped counting at 1,000,"" she says, chuckling. Adjgiwa does not take insurance or partner with hospitals. Her clients find her by word of mouth and pay her in cash. She says she'd prefer to be licensed or work in a birth center. That would allow her to communicate with doctors about patients when she has to transfer them into their care. Adjgiwa says when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, demand for her services increased. ""All of the midwives that I knew, if they already had a busy practice, it just got busier,"" she says. ""Women started losing their faith in the medical system,"" she says, ""when it comes to their own lives and the life inside of them."" Women are going to keep having babies at home, Adjgiwa argues, so it would be better to give families more options that are safe and legal. The Algers' baby is due around Christmas. In the past, Stephen has delivered several of their babies himself when the midwife didn't get there in time."
0,Business,"A General Motors logo is seen at the General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant in Hamtramck, Mich. on Jan. 27, 2020. Paul Sancya/AP hide caption In a quarterly earnings call with investors, the chief financial officer of General Motors said Tuesday morning that tariffs cost the company approximately $1.1 billion over three months, bringing the company's profit margin from 9% down to 6.1% — that is, from meeting their target profitability to falling several percentage points short. CFO Paul Jacobson said that so far, the company has only been able to reduce the blow to profits by a minimal amount. But they're hoping that will change. ""We're still tracking to offset at least 30% of the $4 to $5 billion full-year 2025 tariff impact,"" he said, through a combination of changes in manufacturing, ""targeted cost initiatives,"" and the prices that consumers pay. U.S. tariff policy has been unpredictable and rapidly changing over the last few months , and GM executives acknowledged that's likely to continue. For example, the possibility of bilateral deals between the U.S. and other countries suggests that some of those costs might be avoided entirely. For now, despite a tariff of 25%, GM is still importing vehicles it makes in Korea, including some of its most affordable models. ""They're very much in demand,"" CEO Mary Barra told investors. GM stock dropped 6% after it revealed its earnings, signaling Wall Street's displeasure with the company's strategy so far of absorbing tariffs as a hit to profits. ""To put full year targets in reach,"" analysts Daniel Roska and Christopher Gray of research and brokerage firm Bernstein wrote in a note, ""GM needs to start mitigating tariff cost."" Meanwhile, Stellantis, the automaker that owns the Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Ram brands, reported this week that it paid about $387 million in tariffs over the last quarter, and that production pauses — a strategy to avoid paying tariffs — contributed to a 6% year-over-year decline in the number of vehicles the company shipped to dealers. Industry-wide data has suggested that, at least so far, car manufacturers have mostly absorbed higher tariffs as a hit to their profits, rather than passing them along to customers (many of whom are already balking at new car prices that average nearly $49,000 .) The most recent data from Kelley Blue Book showed the average price that car buyers paid for new vehicles in June was up 1.2% year over year, well below the 10-year average annual increase. ""The modest increase in transaction prices suggests the businesses are absorbing more of the burden and not passing the added costs to consumers — something that will impact profitability if the trend persists,"" Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, wrote in a post accompanying the data."
1,Business,"President Trump with Jerome Powell after nominating him as chair in 2017. Drew Angerer/Getty Images North America hide caption President Trump indicated on Tuesday he would let Jerome Powell serve out his term as Federal Reserve chair, saying ""he's going to be out pretty soon anyway."" The comment comes as the president has relentlessly attacked Powell in recent weeks for not cutting interest rates. Last week, Trump floated the idea of firing Powell before retreating somewhat and adding he's ""not planning"" to fire the Fed chair, though without fully ruling it out. An attempt to fire Powell could spark a legal battle, because the Federal Reserve is set up to function as an independent body free of political interference. Such a move would likely also roil financial markets. On Tuesday, while answering questions from reporters, Trump again attacked Powell for being too cautious on cutting interest rates. ""I call him too late. He's too late all the time,"" Trump said. ""He should have lowered interest rates many times."" He went on to say that Powell is leaving his post soon enough anyway, indicating he was willing to wait out his term as chair of the Fed, which ends on May of next year. Despite the president's attacks, Powell has been adamant he intends to serve out his term as chair. The Fed has held interest rates steady this year in large part over concerns that President Trump's tariffs could spark an increase on inflation. That's after cutting rates by a full percentage point between September and December last year. With concerns over inflation rising again, the Fed is seen as unlikely to cut rates at its next policy meeting later this month. In June, consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year ago , a faster annual clip than in the previous month. Policy makers had previously indicated they may consider cutting rates by half a percentage point later this year. Top government officials have also stepped up their criticism of Powell's tenure at the Fed. On Monday, in a post on social media platform X, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for ""a review"" of the Fed's operations, saying the central bank had excessively extended its purview into areas outside of its core job of setting interest rates. Bessent also called for a review of the Fed's renovation project, which President Trump and some Republican lawmakers have seized on to further attack Powell. The Fed is embarking on a makeover of its offices in Washington, D.C., with the cost of the project soaring from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion in recent years. Powell has pushed back against some of the most sensational claims of the renovations as exaggerated. The Fed has attributed the cost overruns to unexpected developments like excess lead and asbestos, as well as inflation, which has raised the cost of building projects nationwide. Powell has also asked the Fed's inspector general to review the project, in an effort to address complaints about the price tag."
2,Business,"NPR's chief news executive and acting content chief, Edith Chapin, told colleagues Tuesday morning that she has decided to step down. Stephen Voss/NPR hide caption NPR's editor-in-chief and acting chief content officer, Edith Chapin, told colleagues Tuesday morning that she has decided to step down. The veteran news leader's announcement comes just days after the Republican-led Congress, driven largely by President Trump's claims of liberal bias at NPR, voted to strip public broadcasting of all federal funding. Chapin says the choice was hers and not driven by the action in Congress. In a brief interview, she says she surprised NPR CEO Katherine Maher with her decision two weeks ago. ""I have had two big executive jobs for two years, and I want to take a break. I want to make sure my performance is always top-notch for the company,"" Chapin says. She says she expects to stay at NPR until September or October. In a note to staff, Maher thanked Chapin for her work. ""Edith has been an indispensable partner during my first year at NPR, a steady leader for a large part of this organization, and a fantastic collaborator as a member of the executive team,"" she wrote. She did not offer any details about transition planning and interim leadership, saying she would share more once she had it. Chapin joined NPR from CNN in 2012 as chief international editor and rose in the ranks of newsroom leadership. She was promoted to lead the newsroom on a day-to-day basis and was subsequently elevated to senior vice president of news and editor-in-chief over the entire division. In 2023, then-NPR CEO John Lansing united reporting, shows and podcasts. He named Chapin to temporarily hold the new role of chief content officer overseeing the new division. She turned the content job down on a permanent basis, saying that someone with a different skill set needed to chart NPR's strategy for what material to present to audiences and how to fulfill its mission. Nearly two years later, Chapin still holds that role on an acting basis. ""It's not a good time to do it, but it's never a good time,"" Chapin says of her choice to leave. ""I needed to pick a date and share my decision."" The ramifications of the congressional vote could have consequences for years to come for public broadcasting, which aims to serve the entire U.S. population. This week, in interviews with the Status media newsletter's Oliver Darcy and with Texas Public Radio , Maher said that NPR would reduce its operating budget by $8 million in the year ahead to pass that along as fee relief to the most affected stations. NPR typically receives less than 2% of its funds from federal sources. But federal funding makes up a greater share of member stations' revenue — on average about 8% to 10%. Some stations, particularly those serving rural or tribal audiences, receive more than half of their funds from the U.S. government. PBS and its member stations receive, on average, about 15% of revenues from U.S. taxpayers. That is to stop on Oct. 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year. In an interview last week on NPR's Morning Edition with hosts Michel Martin and Steve Inskeep, Maher said she had not given up hope that public broadcasting could ultimately convince lawmakers on Capitol Hill to restore some federal funding. Periodic accusations of bias, especially from conservatives, erupted last year when a veteran NPR business editor wrote an essay in The Free Press asserting that the network had embraced a progressive outlook. Chapin led the effort to hire a new team of senior editors to review broadcast segments, digital stories and podcasts before their release — to ensure both that the stories were fair and accurate, and also that the balance of stories was proportionate to the news of the day. ""The best thing we can do is do the best work possible every day,"" Chapin says now about the debate over bias. ""We need to hear from all kinds of people — and that is our job. And we need to be as clear and transparent as we possibly can, and our audiences can decide how useful we are for them."" That venture was subsidized by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit through which federal funding has been funneled to stations and the networks for decades. Under Chapin, NPR has helped foster the creation of seven regional newsrooms — each distinct in its focus — in which the network's editors have helped oversee collaborative reporting with stations. One of those efforts, The Texas Newsroom, has broken several stories and offered intensive coverage during the deadly floods in Texas. ""One of the things that was attractive when I came here was this philosophy of all things considered,"" Chapin says, playing off the name of NPR's signature evening newsmagazine. ""There is room for so much here in a way there is not in so many places. In offering that fulsome package of things, some people are going to find things they don't find of interest or agree with — and that's OK. I think we have to continue with that philosophy of all things considered."" Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR correspondent David Folkenflik.

4,Business,"In this undated image provided by the CPSC, a child uses the compression strap to stand on above-ground pool. (CPSC via AP) CPSC/AP hide caption NEW YORK — More than 5.2 million aboveground swimming pools sold across the U.S. and Canada over the last two decades are being recalled after nine drowning deaths were reported. The recall covers a range of Bestway, Intex Recreation and Polygroup pools that were sold by major retailers as far back as 2002. According to Monday notices published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada , these pools have compression straps running along the outside of the product — which ""may create a foothold"" for small children and allow them to access the water unattended. That can pose a serious drowning risk, the safety regulatory warn. To date, the CPSC believes nine children across the U.S. have drowned after gaining access to these now-recalled pools in this way. Those deaths occurred between 2007 and 2022, involving children between the ages of 22 months and 3 years old. No additional fatalities have been reported in Canada. Consumers in possession of these pools are urged to immediately contact Bestway , Intex and/or Polygroup to receive a free repair kit — which will consist of a rope to replace the compression strap. Owners of these pools should otherwise ensure that small children cannot access the pool without supervision, regulators note — and could alternatively drain the pool until the repair is made. All of the pools being recalled are 48 inches or taller — and can be identified by brand and model names listed on both the CPSC and Health Canada's recall notices . Sales of the pools ranged by model and location, but date as far back to 2002 and as recently as 2025. About 5 million of these now-recalled pools were sold across the U.S. — including both online and in-stores at major retailers like Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Costco and Amazon. Another 266,000 were sold in Canada."
5,Business,"Jeff Yerxa, co-owner of Lost Sock Roasters, shows bags of coffee beans, many from Brazil, at the company's warehouse in Washington, D.C. The looming threat of a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil — the world's largest coffee producer — has sent shock waves through the U.S. coffee industry. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption At a small, industrial roastery in Washington, D.C., the nutty, inviting smell of roasting coffee hangs heavy in the air. It's where Lost Sock Roasters, a local company, roasts and packages its coffee beans — destined for its two cafes, customers' homes and local bakeries and restaurants. After nearly a decade of running the company with co-founder Nico Cabrera, Lost Sock's Jeff Yerxa says the strong coffee aroma barely registers. ""I can't even smell it anymore,"" he says with a laugh. But something else is grabbing his attention these days: tariffs. This month, President Trump announced plans to levy a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil — the world's largest coffee producer and the source of about 30% of U.S. coffee imports. That's on top of the 10% tariff that impacts nearly everything the U.S. brings in. This looming tariff threat has sent shock waves through the U.S. coffee industry, raising fears especially among small roasters like Lost Sock. ""When people go to their local coffee shop, whether it's Starbucks or something else, by and large they will likely be buying some form of Brazilian coffee,"" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""A 50% tariff will kill that market."" Yerxa holds some green coffee beans before they are roasted at Lost Sock Roasters in Washington, D.C. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption While the tariffs on imports from Brazil, as well as on imports from other nations, aren't set to begin until Aug. 1 , the uncertainty is rattling the industry already. But it's consumers who will end up paying the price, de Bolle, Yerxa and others warn. ""It's a massive price impact ,"" de Bolle says. Tariff threats extend beyond imports from Brazil: The Trump administration has announced a number of tariffs on imports from other coffee-producing countries, like Vietnam (which produces 17% of the world's coffee), Colombia (which produces 8%) and Ethiopia and Indonesia (which produce 6% each). Yerxa says he is trying not to react until he knows details are final, but he says profit margins are already thin. ""It's the uncertainty that's probably the worst."" ""At the end of the day, the consumer is the one that's going to bear the brunt of it,"" he says. ""I don't want to raise prices, but we're seeing increased costs of 30% on coffee, potentially."" An aerial view of a coffee plantation consumed by wildfires in a rural area of Caconde, in Brazil's Sao Paulo state, on Sept. 18, 2024. Andre Penner/AP hide caption The Trump administration defends its trade policy and the dozens of tariffs on a number of countries as necessary to protect American jobs, to renegotiate trade deals and to reduce the trade deficit. In the case of Brazil, Trump also indicated that the proposed tariffs are political retribution for the treatment of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently on trial for trying to overturn the country's 2022 election. For roasters like Yerxa and Colby Barr, CEO and co-founder of Verve Coffee Roasters, a Santa Cruz, Calif.-based craft coffee roaster and wholesaler launched in 2007, much of the administration's reasoning falls flat. The U.S., aside from small coffee farms in Hawaii and California, doesn't produce coffee at the scale that Americans consume it. ""It's a tax on Americans' mornings,"" Barr says. The past several years have been volatile for the coffee industry, contributing to a major increase in market prices for coffee even in the last year, Barr says. The price volatility can be attributed, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic and back-to-back low-yield coffee harvests in Brazil in the last year, Yerxa says. Those weak harvests , in turn, are due to drought and high temperatures and more generally climate change , which has negatively impacted coffee harvests for several years. Coffee producer Jose Natal da Silva sifts coffee beans on his farm in Porciúncula, in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, on July 17. Bruna Prado/AP hide caption Roasted coffee prices in the U.S. surged 12.7% in June compared with a year prior, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Instant coffee saw a 16.3% increase. The average retail price for a pound of ground coffee was $8.13 in June, up more than $1 per pound since the start of the year. Nika Finkelstein says she's already well aware of the sticker shock that comes with buying coffee out. The 27-year-old sat outside Blue Bottle Coffee at Union Station in Washington, D.C., on a recent July afternoon. She makes coffee at home as much as possible. On the rare occasions she buys one out, she sticks with drip coffee rather than specialty drinks, like a latte. If tariffs bump prices even higher? ""I would just have to reel back on spending money at coffee shops and just make it from home, which I can do — it's just not as fun,"" she says. ""There's a certain romance to being able to go to the coffee shop and sit there and read your book or scroll on your phone."" So much coffee in the U.S. comes from Brazil because of the country's large-scale production capacity, low costs, favorable climate and flavor profile, Yerxa and de Bolle say. ""Most of the industry relies on those coffees to be the backbone of their blends,"" Yerxa says, referring to the mixture of beans from different regions. Walking away from longtime partnerships in Brazil really isn't an option, Yerxa says. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption Lost Sock, the D.C. coffee company, is best known for single-origin, higher-end coffees sourced from nearly a dozen countries each year. But it uses Brazilian beans for some of its blends — products that stem from its long-standing relationships with two cooperatives in Brazil. Getting those beans from Brazil to D.C. is a long process that involves international partners, contracts negotiated months to years in advance, and plenty of other planning. Lost Sock coordinates with producers and exporters, and it places orders with them for specific amounts of specific beans from specific Brazilian farms, exports the coffee, and stores it in a U.S. warehouse. The importer adds a margin for logistics, and Yerxa then factors that final price per pound into Lost Sock's wholesale and retail pricing. And where would the tariffs come in? That is initially something that the importer would have to pay once it brings beans into the U.S., he says. ""That tariff would just be another line item on the receipt that we're getting when we release that coffee. And then for us, we take that coffee price, and again it's added on to the price per pound of that coffee, when we come up with the pricing for wholesale and for retail."" Kristen Tizaawie-Vogel (left) prepares a drink at a Lost Sock Roasters coffee shop in Washington, D.C. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption De Bolle explains that if tariffs hit on Aug. 1, it could be a few months before customers feel price increases at cafes or restaurants. That's because those businesses generally buy in bulk and have a stock of coffee that could last them a while — stockpiles like this could last a few months, she says. People who buy their coffee beans at the grocery store could feel the tariff impacts more quickly. ""For people who don't stock up, so the regular consumer who's going to the supermarket … and getting their coffee, maybe those price increases will be felt sooner,"" de Bolle says, adding that coffee is perishable and stocking up on beans can get a business, or consumer, only so far. Long term, if it looks like these tariffs stick, Lost Sock may have to consider pivoting away from using Brazilian coffees in some blends, Yerxa says. Walking away from longtime partnerships in Brazil really isn't an option for him, however. ""It feels unfair to pull out of a relationship when the going gets tough,"" he says. ""So we'll probably bear the brunt of it a little bit, but with the hope that the prices in the future will come back down."" Yerxa brews a cup of coffee with freshly roasted beans at Lost Sock's roastery. Claire Harbage/NPR hide caption But if Brazil's coffee prices go up, coffee roasters will rush to buy from other sources, Barr of Verve Coffee warns. And these other coffee-producing countries, such as Vietnam, are also facing tariffs. ""It's really, really difficult, and more like impossible, to really prepare for it,"" Barr says. ""Tariffs don't help the coffee producer. They don't help the small- and medium-sized businesses across the country, and they don't help the consumer. Why are we doing it?"""

8,Business,"President Trump displays the GENIUS Act — the first major crypto legislation passed by Congress — after signing it in the White House in Washington, D.C., on July 18, 2025. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images hide caption For years, the U.S. government has adopted a hands-off approach to cryptocurrencies, deeming them too dangerous for average Americans — and too risky for the country's financial system. Not anymore. In a historic vote in the House of Representatives earlier this week, Congress approved the country's first ever major crypt legislation, signaling a sea change in the U.S. stance towards these digital currencies. The overall market valuation of cryptocurrencies hit a record $4 trillion soon after the vote in a reflection of the excitement being felt across the sector. And in a ceremony on Friday, President Trump — who has vowed to make America the ""crypto capital of the planet"" — signed the bill into law to the cheers of Republican lawmakers. ""This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance of global finance and crypto technology as we signed the landmark Genius Act into law,"" Trump said. That law sets new rules for a more narrow — yet promising segment of the crypto market called stablecoins. It sets the stage for more laws to come: Two other crypto-related bills are making their way through Congress now. But it's one bill in particular that the crypto sector wants. Called the CLARITY Act, it was also passed by the House on Thursday as part of what Republican lawmakers have called ""crypto week."" The bill would hand policing power of the crypto sector to a smaller regulatory body called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Such a shift would revamp how digital currencies are regulated in the U.S., and critics fear it would lead to far weaker policing of what they consider to be a dangerous segment of the financial sector. It now heads to the Senate where it could face a more uncertain future — and crypto critics have vowed to fight it tooth and nail. For crypto supporters, though, it was a week to savor. The crypto sector has long believed digital currencies represent the future of finance. While they acknowledge there are less savory parts of the sector — such as the ""meme coins"" or cryptocurrencies based on silly Internet trends — they argue cryptos can provide real value. Stablecoins are one example. They are viewed as a safer type of cryptocurrency because each stablecoin must be backed by dollars or other currency such as euros, meaning that if you buy $1 in stablecoin, the issuer that provided it has to keep $1 in reserve. And stablecoin companies see big potential. Because stablecoins are backed by dollars and other currencies, they are effectively considered to be just about as good as cash. An illustration picture shows a gold-plated souvenir Tether stablecoin, along with representations of crypto currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum coins. Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Key industry players believe stablecoins will allow people and companies the ability to transfer money as digital currency anywhere in the world instantaneously, regardless of borders, without onerous and expensive bank or money transfer fees. Any company that receives, say, $100 in stablecoins can simply convert them into $100 in real dollars because each stablecoin has to be backed up. People within the industry believe that is a gamechanger. ""I think over the next 10 to 20 years, we're going to see stablecoins become the default method for commerce,"" says Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of Borderless.xyz, a company that helps stablecoin payments. That's not how critics see it, however. The GENIUS Act does offer some protections, such as mandating stablecoin companies maintain proper reserves and be transparent about how the money is held. The bill also establishes anti-money laundering rules to make it harder for shady actors such as drug dealers to use stablecions. But critics say the rules are too weak and have been too influenced by the crypto industry through heavy lobbying and big campaign donations. The crypto industry spent over $100 million in Congressional races last year and is building an even heftier war chest ahead of next year's midterms. ""It's all hype and there's not much 'there there,'"" says Amanda Fischer, policy director and chief operating officer for consumer advocacy group Better Markets. ""There's certainly problems in the current payment system, but they are not solved by this bill. And in fact, a lot of problems are going to be exacerbated by the bill."" Problems that would ultimately hurt consumers and the economy if stablecoins get increasingly adopted without adequate protections. The stablecoin industry strongly defends the rules put in place by the GENIUS Act, however, which was passed with significant Democratic support. ""The law sets a very, very clear, standard, one that even banks, large banks would have to abide by if they issue payments in stablecions,"" says Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer for Circle, which issues one of the world's largest stablecoins. ""You wouldn't have had 102 Democrats voting alongside the Republican counterparts for the Genius Act if it was going to fail such a simple test as consumer protection,"" he adds. ""I think this bill does the most of any financial regulation we have had in decades if not in American history in terms of advancing a pro-growth, pro-competition pro-consumer agenda."" House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) , along with lawmakers and administration officials applaud as President Donald Trump signs the ""GENIUS Act"" into law during a ceremony at the White House in Washington, D.C., on July 18, 2025. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images North America hide caption But despite the criticism, the crypto sector believes the wind is on its side. The crypto industry is armed with millions of dollars they can steer towards campaign donations — and backed by the most powerful supporter of all: President Trump. Trump and his family have controversially waded into the crypto sector, with financial interests in World Liberty Financial, a company that's investing in different aspects of the industry, including in launching its own stablecoin. For the crypto sector, the next big target is now the CLARITY Act. The bill intends to take away some of the policing power from the Securities and Exchange Commission, widely considered as Wall Street's cop — but which had antagonized the crypto sector under the Biden administration. Under previous chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC went hard after the crypto sector along with the Department of Justice, including helping convict former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was ultimately sentenced to over 20 years in prison. The goal under the Biden administration was to get crypto companies to comply with the same rules that Wall Street firms and other financial firms must follow. But crypto companies have long maintained that digital currencies are a new, innovative financial product that needs its own set of rules — rules that critics and cynics say the crypto sector would like to shape to its advantage by spending heavily in elections. ""People can end up being put in a situation with the worst of all worlds, where they have all these new products flying at them with less oversight and more risk,"" says Mark Hays, associate director for cryptocurrency and financial technology at Americans for Financial Reform. ""We're waging an uncontrolled experiment on our financial system using a technology that hasn't delivered yet as promised."" For now though — with a major victory at hand after the historic passage of the GENIUS Act — the crypto industry marches on."
9,Business,"Many of us know the old adage to save money: Buy what you need, not what you want. But even when money is tight, it's a hard rule to follow. It's OK to buy what you want every now and then, but the key is to be intentional, says Aja Evans , a licensed mental health counselor and financial therapist. Consider your budget, the occasion and even your mood.  ""What's going on with me emotionally? Am I just buying this because I am upset? Am I buying this because I have this dream that this is gonna solve all my problems?"" she says. To make more mindful purchases, Evans and Brian Vines , a reporter at Consumer Reports, share questions to ask yourself. If you answer ""yes"" to any of these queries, you may want to reevaluate your purchase. If you have to pull funds from what you've set aside for basic needs like housing, groceries, transportation or credit card payments, hold off on spending, Evans says. Don't pull from your emergency fund or the money you've saved for vacations, either. To ensure you've got enough cash for, say, impulse buys at the checkout line, create a line item for fun stuff in your monthly budget, Evans says. Be realistic. ""If you deprive yourself too much, you will not stick to it."" If you find yourself feeling spendy, check in with yourself using the acronym HALT, a tool developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, Evans says. Are you hungry, angry, lonely or tired? If so, there may be some other way you can fill that need without swiping your card. Eat a piece of chocolate at home, or do something that feels good, like going for a walk in the sun. If you examine your shopping patterns — as well as their underlying motivations — you may find that you don't actually want to own a new thing. You just love the dopamine rush of discovering a new treasure and making a purchase. We Are/Getty Images hide caption Put your desire to spend into context. Let's say you love hunting for treasures at estate sales. ""If every weekend you're going to different antique stores to search, peel back a layer and ask what's going on,"" Evans says. ""How often are you shopping in this kind of way?"" You may find that you don't actually want to own a new thing. You just love the dopamine rush of discovering a new treasure and making a purchase. That awareness may be enough to put that card back in your wallet. Sometimes we buy the latest and greatest because we think it will bring us status, Evans says. ""Maybe you want people to look at you a certain way, and having this item may signify something [important]."" If this is the case, reflect on why this item matters so much to your self-esteem, and ask yourself why you care so much about what others think. ""That's where the juicy stuff starts to happen,"" she says. So you've decided to get a new mattress. Before you hit the ""Buy Now"" button, shop around for the best price and read reviews to make sure you're getting a good product, Vines says. Don't assume that more expensive products are higher quality, he says. ""Price does not guarantee performance."" At the same time, don't buy something cheap when you can save up for something more expensive that will last. If you're not sure what to get, ask friends and family members for recommendations. ""Call your rich aunt who buys all the things you're interested in having and see if she actually likes it,"" Vines says. ""Call the person you know who is the most cost-conscious and ask them questions."" Let's say you have a craving for a doughnut. You head to the bakery to find that it's sold out. Should you get something else? For Vines, the answer is no. ""I'm not going to take a muffin or half a pie or a slice of tiramisu when I want one doughnut,"" he says.

11,Business,"An aerial view picture of the port of Santos, the largest port complex in Latin America and one of the largest in the world, taken on Thursday in Santos, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Nelson Almeida/AFP via Getty Images hide caption President Trump's tariff letters to world leaders are attracting a lot of attention. But that's not the entirety of his trade strategy. This week he also floated the idea of pharmaceutical tariffs, for example. ""Pharmaceuticals will be tariffed probably at the end of the month,"" he told reporters. ""And we're going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build. And then we're going to make it a very high tariff."" Broadly, Trump is imposing two different, overlapping sets of tariffs, authorized by two different laws. One set includes the tariffs he's announcing in those country-by-country letters. Those are known in trade circles as IEEPA tariffs, for the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Then there's the tariffs on various products, like pharmaceuticals. Those are known as Section 232 tariffs — named for a part of a 1962 trade law. Those tariffs aren't as sweeping as the IEEPA tariffs, but they cover a large portion of imports. In addition, experts say they're more likely to withstand legal challenges. Trump has used Section 232 a lot. ""I think his use of it could be fairly characterized as revolutionary in his first term,"" said Tim Keeler, a trade lawyer who served at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office under President George W. Bush. ""It really hadn't been utilized very much prior to his coming to office."" The first step to imposing one of these tariffs is a Commerce Department investigation. Prior to Trump, the last such investigation was in 2001 . Currently, Trump has two sets of 232 tariffs in place and nine more in process . A key topic in those investigations is national security — by law, Section 232 tariffs are supposed to help bolster national security. Not everyone thinks Trump's tariffs will do that, though. ""I think the argument that it is important to have a healthy steel and aluminum industry in the United States is a respectable one,"" said Ed Gresser of the Progressive Policy Institute. ""But the argument that you can create this through tariffs has some pretty serious flaws."" A more efficient way to boost a domestic industry, he said, is through subsidies. Gresser, who worked for the U.S. Trade Representative under President Joe Biden, also noted that, for example, ships and aircraft are important to national security, and 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum make those more expensive. It's also possible that imposing global 232 tariffs might be actively bad for national security, according to Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. ""If we can all agree that de-risking and diversifying away from China is a national security priority, then we should be developing much stronger relationships with our allies,"" he said. ""At the same time we are now putting tariffs on steel and aluminum from our friends and allies, who we should really be working together with to strengthen our economy."" The Trump administration, for its part, says domestic manufacturing is better for national security than relying on other countries. Gresser, at the Progressive Policy Institute, calculates that the Section 232 tariffs would apply to around 30% of imports. The IEEPA tariffs, by comparison, would cover 70%. That might make the 232 tariffs look small, but Gresser stresses that they're still sizable. ""They're still very big, and they can be expanded. You could file more of these cases,"" he said. Furthermore, the 232 tariffs might be more of a sure bet, legally speaking. Earlier this year, a federal court ruled that the country-by-country tariffs are illegal. The Trump administration is appealing that decision, and for now, those tariffs are still in place — set at 10% on nearly all imports, with some exceptions. The higher tariffs the president threatened in that flurry of letters to other world leaders who didn't cut trade deals with him are scheduled to go into effect on Aug. 1. Section 232 tariffs, on the other hand, have already been tested, said Keeler, the trade lawyer. ""They were challenged in court by multiple different facets, all which were upheld at the federal circuit level,"" he said. All of this underscores a common criticism of Trump's tariff approach: that it's too broad. ""The real challenge in the current environment is that we're seeing tariffs as a hammer and every problem with our allies and adversaries — whether economic or not — as a nail,"" said Colvin with the National Foreign Trade Council."
12,Business,"Nearly sixty years after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 into law, Congress voted to take back federal funding already promised for the public media system. The Republican majority has accused PBS and NPR of left-leaning bias and being a waste of taxpayer funds. Bettmann/Bettmann Archive hide caption When President Lyndon B. Johnson spoke after signing the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, he marveled at technologies like radio and television and satellites, and echoed the words of Samuel Morse in sending the first telegraph message. ""What hath man wrought?"" Johnson asked . ""And how will man use his inventions?"" Johnson offered an answer to his own question: ""While we work every day to produce new goods and to create new wealth, we want most of all to enrich man's spirit. That is the purpose of this act."" The years that followed brought forth the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, PBS and NPR, largely with bipartisan support. It also led to a framework of laws intended to ensure those organizations were protected from political pressure. CPB began funneling an ongoing subsidy to hundreds of public media outlets across the country. Out of that system came original programs that have become familiar to all corners of the country: Sesame Street . PBS NewsHour . All Things Considered . Tiny Desk . NOVA . Antiques Roadshow . Wait Wait…Don't Tell Me! A poster at a March 26 rally to protect funding for U.S. public broadcasters, PBS and NPR outside the NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption They were on the air, online, and on platforms that Johnson could never have envisioned. All helped foster a sense there was something for everyone. That seeming consensus, under sustained attack, was shattered this week. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have passed legislation on a narrow, party-line basis to eliminate all federal funding for public broadcasting for the next two years. That's $1.1 billion previously approved by the Republican-led Congress and President Trump. The reversal is notionally due to the need to cut funds to help pay for new Republican priorities, including an expansion of immigration enforcement and extension of Trump's prior tax cuts. Yet Trump had campaigned on retribution and made the news media a core element of his grievance. Public broadcasting has offered a ready target, given the government funding, and he has repeatedly claimed NPR and PBS demonstrate ideological bias. Last week, the president ramped up pressure on wavering GOP lawmakers, posting , ""Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement."" Another Johnson — Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana — said on Tuesday the time had come to turn off federal largesse to public media. ""This is, in our view, the misuse of taxpayer dollars,"" he said. ""They're not objective. They pretend to be so."" ""In its origination, NPR and PBS might have made some sense,"" Johnson added. ""But it shouldn't be subsidized by taxpayers."" While NPR receives just a small amount of direct federal government support — less than 2% of its annual revenue — PBS and local stations rely on it far more heavily. For public radio stations, federal funding makes up, on average, 8-10% of their budgets; for PBS and its member stations, the figure stands on average at about 15%. But that level varies widely. Executives at small stations — especially those that serve rural or tribal audiences — warn they could be devastated or even knocked off the air when aid from Washington fails to arrive at the start of the fiscal year in October. Tri-State Public Media in southwest Indiana puts a special emphasis on agricultural coverage and has a show dedicated to food and farming given the importance of that industry in its region. It already is suffering from a loss of funding from the state government. About a third of its revenue comes from Washington. Tim Black, the chief executive, says the loss of federal funds would be ""pretty darn close to being catastrophic."" He says the station can drain its financial reserves and sell off its headquarters to survive another year or two. After that, it may go off the air. Others are preparing for a smaller, scrappier future. ""I came here because what we do, we do for free. We try to reach everyone regardless of their ability to pay,"" says Sue Rogers, the executive vice president and general manager of WXXI, the NPR and PBS member stations in Rochester, N.Y. ""It will test every single shred of creativity we have to continue to try to serve our mission, which we will do,"" Rogers says. Yet she warns that public media stations won't be able to do all they do now. ""We know that we can do it as best we can, but there will be communities left out and there will be issues uncovered and there will be much lost, in my opinion,"" Rogers says. And she points to the $545 million saved annually — less than 1/100 of 1% of the U.S. government's multi-trillion-dollar annual budget. ""All for such a tiny — really, $1.60 a person in this country per year — for a tiny commitment of dollars,"" Rogers says. Beyond the loss of the direct federal subsidy, NPR and PBS executives say privately they expect to feel the ripple effects of budget crises at member stations. While the stations receive the vast majority of federal funds, they use a significant amount of that money to pay the networks for the right to run their programs. Yet it will be hard for many of them to go without: Those national programs serve audiences throughout much of the day and help propel stations' fundraising drives. Twenty years ago in our first in-person conversation, I asked then-NPR Chief Executive Ken Stern whether the network should forgo the $1 million subsidy it received at the time in order to escape periodic political flare-ups. Then-President George W. Bush's appointee as CPB board chairperson had accused PBS of liberal bias and was pressuring the network over specific programming choices. It was an off-the-record, get-to-know-you chat, though Stern doesn't mind my reflecting on it here all these years later. Stern told me it was important that NPR receive some federal funds so it would have ""a place at the table"" and could advocate for public radio stations. On Wednesday, I asked him to revisit his thinking. ""It worked until it didn't,"" Stern says now. Stern says the local stations always enjoyed more favor from lawmakers — even conservatives — than the national networks. ""Even today, I suspect that, left to their own devices, many Republicans would still vote for funding,"" Stern says. ""It's just that now every vote is a political loyalty test, unfortunately."" While a few Republican senators voiced support for local member stations over the past week, nearly all condemned NPR, including Maine's Susan Collins, often considered the most liberal Republican in the Senate. Six years after my conversation with Stern, another controversy exploded the tenure of one of his successors, Vivian Schiller. Commentator Juan Williams had just been ousted by her chief news executive over remarks he had made on Fox News. Then an undercover camera stunt by right-wing provocateur James O'Keefe cemented her fate. Republicans used NPR as a rallying cry in the waning weeks of the 2010 elections to help take back the U.S. House of Representatives. Schiller argues this week's votes were inevitable and that NPR leaders should have prepared for this action by walking away from the funds long ago. ""Any evidence-based news organization that reports critically is going to be accused of left-wing bias,"" Schiller says. ""Journalism and government funding in the United States — those two things are incompatible."" ""That said, when I see these accusations of bias against what I consider one of the finest news organizations in the world, it's very, very painful,"" Schiller says. ""These accusations against NPR's news organization are flat-out wrong. So that's where we are. It's excruciating."" Former NPR CEO Vivian Schiller says NPR should've stopped accepting federal funding long ago. ""Any evidence-based news organization that reports critically is going to be accused of left-wing bias,"" she says. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for Unfinished Live/Getty Images North America hide caption While PBS stirs controversy too, NPR's far more expansive news coverage draws the lion's share of public outrage. The late former CEO John Lansing , who retired in early 2024, considered diversity in hiring and programming choices both a moral imperative and a business strategy to broaden its reach. NPR's staff came closer to reflecting America's racial and ethnic complexity. Its audiences did not appreciably budge. Conservatives noted the shift and often criticized it. They also singled out NPR coverage of Hunter Biden's laptop , the question of the origins of the COVID-19 virus and issues concerning LGBTQ people — particularly transgender rights. Some people with ties to NPR agree with elements of the criticism. Bruce Drake, a former vice president for news at NPR in the early 2000s, argues that the network has lost more support from its audiences than it is willing to admit — and not simply due to changes in how people consume media in the digital age. ""The NPR issue is not as much political bias as its sound, cultural orientation, sensibilities and tone — the same things that the Democrats were so tone deaf about in the [2024] election,"" writes Drake. Last year, Uri Berliner, then a veteran business editor at the network, published an essay in the Free Press that revived the issue. Berliner castigated the network for embracing what he characterized as a progressive mindset instead of a more open-minded quest for truth in its reporting. He asked for a meeting with NPR's new chief executive, Katherine Maher, who had started days earlier. She declined. He left NPR for the Free Press soon after. Berliner says the Senate vote marks ""a sad day."" ""NPR was a treasured national trust,"" Berliner said in a text message. ""It no longer is one. Instead of restoring the journalism gold standard of neutral impartiality the NPR leadership chose to squander the last year as the network doubled down on agenda-driven journalism by and for progressives. So here we are."" After Berliner's essay was published, conservative critics of NPR scoured Maher's social media posts. They found she had condemned Trump during his first term and proclaimed support for then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020. Being CEO of NPR is Maher's first job in journalism; the network's board said she was entitled to such views in a prior life. She nonetheless became a lightning rod for Republican lawmakers in the 16 months since. NPR CEO and President Katherine Maher testifies during a House Oversight Committee hearing in March. Anadolu/Anadolu via Getty Images/Anadolu hide caption NPR officials have resolutely defended the fairness of the network's reporting, though they say they are open to criticism. In an effort to shore up public trust, Maher and NPR's chief content officer created a senior editing team to ensure high-level review and awareness of all news content before broadcast or posting. That was paid for by a grant from the CPB. Some station managers say they, too, have periodically complained about news judgment to the network. But they attest to the value provided by NPR and PBS programming and news coverage. Others have spoken of the reporting collaborations NPR has fostered in recent years as a success. Texas Public Radio in San Antonio has taken the lead on reporting on the recent deadly floods in the Lone Star State. But Dan Katz, the station's news director, cites a collaboration with The Texas Newsroom, a joint project with other public media stations in the state, in helping him break news. That newsroom has been cultivated in part with federal money in CPB grants, Katz says. Ironically, as political debate over NPR has led Trump's congressional allies to wipe out federal funds for public broadcasting, several station officials say they have never worked more closely with the network to deliver top-notch local coverage of regions far from NPR's headquarters in Washington or major bureaus in New York or Los Angeles. Maria O'Mara, the executive director of PBS Utah, NPR affiliate KUER and the bilingual station Avanza, says she's ready to move on from the political debate. ""It has just drained us of time and energy and brain power that we need to face other existential questions about our system and our public service,"" she says. She hopes stations now forge an even stronger relationship with the national networks and each other to become more viable and vibrant. ""It is about public service,"" she says. ""We are needed by our listeners. We feel that clarity of mission."" Disclosure: This story was written and reported by NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik.

14,Business,"Stephen Colbert at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Calif., on April 21, 2024. Kevin Winter/Getty Images hide caption While taping his Thursday show,  host Stephen Colbert made the surprising announcement that CBS is ending his late night show in May. The live audience at New York's Ed Sullivan Theater booed when he delivered the news that this would be the show's final season. ""Yeah, I share your feelings,"" he told the audience. ""It's not just the end our our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS. I'm not being replaced. This is all just going away."" A post shared by The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) Colbert has hosted the top-rated show since 2015, taking over for David Letterman. The news comes just days after Colbert criticized CBS's parent company, Paramount Global, for paying $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, whom Colbert regularly skewers in his monologues.  Trump claimed the network interfered in the 2024 election by editing a 60 Minutes interview with his opponent, Kamala Harris. The decision to shutter Late Night With Stephen Colbert also comes as Paramount Global seeks Federal Communications Commission approval to merge with Skydance Media, a $8.4 billion agreement. In a statement, the network said ending the show was a financial decision, ""not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount."" But fans are skeptical. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who was a guest on Thursday's show, called for more transparency over the decision.  ""If Paramount and CBS ended The Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know,"" he posted on X. "" And deserves better."" Just finished taping with Stephen Colbert who announced his show was cancelled. If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and others on social media also weighed in, expressing skepticism about the timing of the decision to end the show. Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts also commented in a letter to Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone. ""Paramount should not be making editorial decisions or compromising its editorial independence at the behest of or under pressure from the government, including in the context of securing FCC merger approval,"" Markey wrote. ""If the Trump administration is using its regulatory authority to influence or otherwise pressure your company's editorial decisions, the public deserves to know."" The Writers Guild of America is demanding that the New York state attorney general investigate the cancellation.  ""Given Paramount's recent capitulation to President Trump in the CBS News lawsuit, the Writers Guild of America has significant concerns that The Late Show 's cancellation is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump Administration as the company looks for merger approval,"" the WGA said in a statement. Colbert's fans started a Change.org petition asking CBS to reverse the decision to cancel the show. Colbert's fellow late night show hosts Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers have all posted statements of support. But President Trump celebrated the news.  ""I absolutely love that Colbert' got fired,"" he posted on Truth Social. ""I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next."""
15,Business,"Former Meta board member and former White House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients, left, exits the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center after testifying in a shareholders' lawsuit against current and former Meta leaders on Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in Wilmington, Del. Mingson Lau/AP hide caption A settlement was announced Thursday in court in a class action investors' lawsuit against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and current and former company leaders over claims stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm. The suit had sought billions of dollars in reimbursement for fines and legal costs. No details on the settlement were shared when it was announced in Delaware's Court of Chancery at the start of what would have been the second day of trial, at which point nothing related to the settlement had been filed with the court. The attorneys involved left court without commenting. A communications representative from Meta said the company had no comment. Investors had alleged in the lawsuit that Meta did not fully disclose the risks to Facebook users that their personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump's successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016. Shareholders say Facebook officials repeatedly violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data without users' consent. Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleged. Facebook agreed to pay a $5.1 billion penalty to settle FTC charges in the fallout. The social media giant also faced significant fines in Europe and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users. Shareholders wanted Zuckerberg and others to reimburse Meta an estimated $8 billion or more for the FTC fine and other legal costs. Zuckerberg and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg had been expected to testify. Other current and former board members, including billionaires Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel, were also included as defendants. Earlier this year, Sandberg was sanctioned for deleting emails from her personal account related to the Cambridge Analytica investigation. Jeffrey Zients, who served as an outside director from 2018 to 2020, avoided sanctions in the same case because his role made it less likely he had access to relevant information. Testifying on the first day of this lawsuit, Zients said he had supported the FTC settlement for which shareholders were seeking reimbursement."
16,Business,"A picture taken in London shows a gold-plated souvenir stablecoin issued by Tether. Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images hide caption The United States Congress passed the country's first major standalone crypto bill on Thursday. The landmark vote signals a sea change in the U.S. stance toward these digital currencies. The House approved the GENIUS Bill with a 308-122 vote with significant Democratic support, adopting regulations for a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins that proponents believe will fundamentally change the world of commerce. It was a remarkable win for the crypto industry — and for President Trump, who campaigned on making the U.S. ""the crypto capital of the planet."" He, along with his family, also stand to benefit from this, given their financial interests in a crypto company that has issued its own stablecoin. In fact, the president had a key role to play in its passage. Although the House easily had the votes to pass the bill during what it had dubbed ""Crypto Week,"" it came after an arduous process when some Republican lawmakers objected to the way leaders had intended to pass two other crypto bills. It ultimately required President Trump's intervention to convince the lawmakers and then a really long vote to clear all the procedural hurdles. The GENIUS Bill, which stands for ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoin"" now heads to the president's desk for his signature, since the Senate had already approved it last month. ""Advancement of this bill to President Trump's desk marks a historic milestone for crypto entrepreneurs, financial market participants, and everyday Americans,"" said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins in a statement. With its passage, the U.S. is now formally adopting a new set of rules for cryptocurrencies — ones that critics view as far too easy. It also marks a sharp turn from the Biden administration's approach of seeking to get crypto companies follow the far tougher rules for Wall Street. More crypto legislation is expected to follow the GENIUS Act. There's another bill intended to provide more clarity about which regulatory agencies will oversee the different aspects of crypto. Another seeks to ban the U.S. from adopting a digital version of the dollar. Those, however, now need to be passed by the Senate. The new legislation will put more formal regulations around stablecoins, which is viewed by many as a safer type of cryptocurrency. That's because companies selling stablecoins have to hold the equivalent dollars in reserve. So if you buy $1 in stablecoin, the issuer that provided you with one has to keep $1 in reserve. That means that when you want to cash it, you can get paid back promptly. Stablecoins are a hot emerging part of the crypto sector. Key industry players believe stablecoins will allow people and companies the ability to transfer money as digital currency anywhere in the world instantaneously, regardless of borders, without onerous and expensive bank or money transfer fees. They believe that the world of credit cards or wire transfers will be completely upended once they are adopted widely. President Trump speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tenn., last year when he was running for another term at the White House. Trump has emerged as a vocal supporter of cryptocurrencies. Jon Cherry/Getty Images North America hide caption It's attracted a lot of interest from banks such as JPMorganChase and retailers like Amazon and Walmart, all of whom are said to be considering launching their own stablecoins. For the retailers it could mean avoiding the credit card fees they pay when customers make purchases. Controversially, even President Trump now stands to benefit financially from stablecoins. World Liberty Financial, in which his family has financial interests, has issued a stablecoin called USD1 (though it's market share is miniscule). Passage of the bill came after intense lobbying from the crypto industry, which spent over $100 million in Congressional races last year and is building an even heftier war chest ahead of next year's midterms. That kind of spending had critics calling foul. ""This is what political power can buy you,"" says Corey Frayer, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America. The crypto sector's war chest not only helps win supporters, Frayer says, they also silence Democrats and other lawmakers who might be opposed but ""are just plain scared that crypto is going to come to their town and spend enormous amounts of money against them."" Among other aspects, the bill seeks to formalize rules for stablecoins, mandating that companies must ensure they are holding proper reserves and are providing information about their holdings. It also introduces anti-money laundering rules and other regulations intended to address concerns that stablecoins are being used by criminals such as ransomware hackers, drug cartels or even regimes under sanction. But critics warn the rules are not strong enough, and they add that the bill would allow non-financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins without having to follow all the rules that banks and other financial firms must follow. ""The stablecoin industry has claimed that it is a new payment system with better infrastructure than the payment system we've been using for years,"" says Frayer. ""But the purpose of the bill is to give them the veil of regulation."""
17,Business,"In Empire of the Elite, Michael Grynbaum tracks Condé Nast's decades of cultural dominance up through its decline today. Above, Vogue magazines at a newsstand during VOGUE World: New York in 2022. Sean Zanni/Getty Images for Vogue hide caption In June, Anna Wintour announced she was stepping away from her editor-in-chief role at Vogue — a position she'd held for nearly 40 years. The decision came as a surprise — and indicated a major moment of transition and succession in the magazine world. ""People no longer read print magazines the way they used to,"" says New York Times correspondent Michael Grynbaum. ""And Vogue , it still is a global brand — it still has recognition around the world. But now there are thousands of influencers and social media channels where people get ideas about dressing and glamor and clothing and taste."" In a new book, Grynbaum explores how Condé Nast publications were the arbiters of taste for decades in the U.S. ""They were the tastemakers, they were the gatekeepers,"" Grynbaum says. He says Condé Nast today is a husk of its former self — thanks in part to shifting tastes, and social media, which has provided a platform for celebrities and influencers. Grynbaum's new book is called Empire of the Elite: Inside Condé Nast, the Media Dynasty That Reshaped America. He says he was curious about how ""one of the great cultural institutions of 20th century America … such a powerful group of cultural tastemakers could so miss the changes in our culture and end up in this attenuated state that they're in today."" On Condé Nast as the tastemaker Condé Nast was … a group of self-appointed experts who worked in an office building in Manhattan, and they were the arbiters. … Here's the movie you should be watching this month; Here's a book you should be thinking about; Here's a new celebrity that you should be tracking. This was a one-way street. Condé Nast was kind of built on this idea of authority. … That was the presiding philosophy of the company going back to its founding in 1909. … Vogue magazine was created by a New York society set to essentially say: Here are the rules for being an elite person in New York City, an elite in America at the turn of the 20th century. And that really infused these magazines right up until, I would argue, the last 10, 15 years. On the company's longtime focus on luxury and consumption The company's history kind of goes back to the Gilded Age, which is when there first was an American leisure class, when there was a new group of Americans who were socially mobile, upwardly mobile, who had disposable income for the first time and were looking to find ways to express themselves through clothing, through interior decorating. So the company has a long history of appealing to this kind of upper middle brow audience. In the 1980s, this was the Gordon Gekko Wall Street era … a time when people were celebrating materialism, were celebrating consumption. On the glamorous lifestyle of editors in Condé Nast's heyday I call them influencers before influencers. The idea was that the editor-in-chief, their entire life should be a top-to-bottom marketing campaign for their magazine and for Condé Nast, the company. … If you were editor-in-chief of a Condé Nast magazine, you had a full-time black town car on demand, usually with a driver that would take you out to any event you needed to go, wait for you on the sidewalk, pick you up, bring you home. You would fly first class to Europe or anywhere you need to go for travel. A lot of people had wardrobe allowances. If you were at the fashion magazines, I talked to editors who would come in with a $40,000 annual clothing allowance, and that was considered modest by Condé Nast standards back then. … To wear out at events, to meet with advertisers, to be out at fashion shows, to essentially wear the flag of Condé Nast, to project this idea that we were the best of the best, and you better listen to what we have to say. On Condé Nast's razor thin margins Condé Nast, they just spent. They spent on photo shoots. They felt that waste was an important part of creativity. That was one of the guiding maxims within the company. Condé Nast, they just spent. They spent on photo shoots. They felt that waste was an important part of creativity. That was one of the guiding maxims within the company. All of the spending to outsiders seemed irrational and made no sense. … There was an internal logic to it, which is that Condé Nast was kind of predicated on a myth. And the entire organization for many years, it was built around propagating this idea that they were untouchable, that there was a mystique to everyone in this charmed company. And that's what made readers want to subscribe to own a piece of that fantasy land. And it made the advertisers from luxury brands want to buy pages in these magazines, because they felt that they could make their products part of the fantasy. …Their profits were so razor thin. I mean, they were just barely in the black. And this is back when magazines were a hugely lucrative and profitable business. Condé Nast, they just spent. They spent on photo shoots. They felt that waste was an important part of creativity. That was one of the guiding maxims within the company. On Anna Wintour putting celebrities on the cover of Vogue Back in the '80s, fashion was a very small, insular world. It really wasn't part of our popular culture. Anna Wintour, when she took over Vogue , she started putting celebrities on the cover of the magazine. And I mean, that's so common now. I didn't even realize there was a time when that wasn't true. … Anna Wintour put Madonna on an early cover of her magazine, which a lot of the traditionalists actually were furious about. Because at the time, Madonna was seen as this controversial and sort of vulgar character. And Anna said that she's one of the biggest celebrities of the world, and we're going to dress her in a way that we felt was appropriate to Vogue magazine. And it was a huge, huge seller. And that starts a period where celebrities start to really fill the pages of Vogue . And at the same time, fashion itself becomes celebrated. Fashion itself becomes, it gets up there with music and film, and it's one of the, I guess, the popular arts that we follow. So that rise of fashion paralleled Anna's own rise in prominence. It was kind of a mutually beneficial phenomenon. On the way GQ, under editor Art Cooper, changed men's style in the '80s and '90s I talked to a lot of editors who worked back then — they were almost tricking straight men into reading a magazine about clothing and about grooming. So they would have bikini models and sex columns and sorts of things you might find in Playboy or another magazine like that. And in between, there'd be these literary articles about a double-breasted versus a single-breasted suit and what the best kind of socks you could wear to a party or a wedding. And it was like a system of sneaking in menswear into a straight man's magazine. And it really took off, it was a phenomenon. It had a huge readership. That was a pretty major sea change in the way that men thought about clothes. … It was the start of ""metrosexuality."" … Nowadays, think about the menswear influencers that we see on TikTok and Instagram. Think about athletes, the basketball stars who show off their brand new Thom Browne suits when they're walking to the locker room. So I really trace a lot of that change to what happened at GQ under Condé Nast. On what Tina Brown, former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker , called ""the mix"" The high-low blend is so absorbed into our media today that it's almost hard to believe it didn't exist back then. … Back in the early '80s when there were only so many magazines and newspapers that we consumed, most of them were very specifically focused. And so you might get Time magazine to find out what happened in the news that week. You might read the Atlantic Monthly for something more literary. … Tina Brown … created this blend where you would have a smart political profile about Gary Hart, who was trying to be the vice presidential candidate in 1984, and then a beautiful Annie Leibovitz photograph spread of, say, Daryl Hannah, and then a short story by Norman Mailer or Gore Vidal. And this was really unlike anything that was in the market back then. Readers hadn't really experienced something like this. The fact that she blended high and low, popular culture, high culture, politics, celebrity, true crime. … It was all there in this beautifully packaged pulp and ink product that arrived through your mail slot once a month — and that was the zeitgeist. On The New Yorker succeeding with the paywall model It's kind of an amazing turnaround because The New Yorker was starting to lose money when Condé Nast bought it. … The Newhouse family, which still controls Condé Nast, I really think they see The New Yorker as an heirloom. And I think they take very seriously their role as the stewards of it. [Editor] David Remnick encouraged the family to invest in an online website, and they introduced a paywall, a subscription service fairly early on compared to other magazines. … It really is a success story that is now one of the Condé magazines that, at least as of a few years ago, was turning a profit. I like to think of this as a nice sign about the enduring power of the written word, that great writing, great editing still has an audience, a devoted audience that's willing to pay for it.

18,Business,"The Federal Reserve building in Washington D.C. Karen Bleier/AFP via Getty Images hide caption The Federal Reserve building in Washington D.C. A former head of a Federal Reserve Bank says the Fed's independence from politics is ""one of the foundational elements of a well-run economy."" ""The benefits of independence stem from the fact that the Fed and monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. And so you want to insulate it from short-run political considerations,"" Loretta Mester, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told Morning Edition. President Trump has floated the idea of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who he's expressed frustration with for months for not lowering interest rates. Trump says Powell's refusal to lower the rates is hurting the economy. The Fed has been wary of lowering interest rates as it assesses the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation. Consumer prices are up 2.7% compared to a year ago , which is a larger annual increase than the month before. If Trump were to fire Powell, that could undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. Powell has said previously that Trump cannot lawfully fire him before his term ends in May 2026. NPR's Steve Inskeep spoke with Mester, now a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, about what the Fed does and why its independence is fundamental to the U.S. economy. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Steve Inskeep : Why would the markets want an independent Federal Reserve? Loretta Mester : Well, independence is one of the foundational elements of a well-run economy. The benefits of independence stem from the fact that the Fed and monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. And so you want to insulate it from short-run political considerations. And that's kind of the system that we've had since the early '50s. Monetary policymakers focus on hitting the dual mandate goals that Congress gave it, which are price stability and maximum employment. And they steer away from commenting on fiscal policy. And then the fiscal policy makers, including the president, try to steer away from commenting on monetary policy. And that's good because you don't want the person who's setting interest rates to be concerned about trying to inflate away the debt, which maybe a politician has in mind, or setting interest rates low to gin up the economy before an election without consideration of what the long run implications for inflation are. So you want to separate those two duties, and that's the system that we've had in the U.S. Inskeep : Let me put in front of you, though, the Trump administration's broad argument, not just about the Federal Reserve, but about every corner of the executive branch, every corner of the U.S. government, [and] every dollar the government spends somewhere. Their argument is that when someone like Jerome Powell says, 'I know best and I have this independent position,' they're trying to be independent of the people who elected the president and that that's not small 'd' democratic. Do you see it that way at all? Mester : I do not, because this is how Congress designed the Fed. Inskeep : Oh! And Congress was elected. Thanks for the reminder. Mester : Yes. They set the goals and then they've given over to the experts, monetary policy makers, the ability to use their best judgment to set policy to meet those goals. Being independent in setting monetary policy does not mean the central bank is unaccountable for its decisions. And Jerome Powell and the other Fed chairs have always gone to Congress and reported on their policy decisions. The rationale. Chair Powell does news conferences after each decision to explain to the public why the Fed made the decision it made, what the goals are, how they're meeting the goals. So there's accountability there. But you really want to insulate the Fed and those monetary policy decisions from those short run considerations a politician may have. Inskeep : I just want to note that you served in a time when there were three different presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump the first time, and also Joe Biden. While Trump has been unusually loud about the Fed chairman, it's been thought that presidents from time to time have had strong opinions about this and sometimes try to convey it. Did you ever feel the pressure of a president during your decade inside the Fed? Mester : I honestly never had politics put in my view of what we would do at monetary policy. When you come into that room, you set all those outside things aside and you really focus on the best analysis that you can bring to bear on where the economy's going and how to best place monetary policy to foster maximum employment and price stability. And so at that table, at the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) table, politics never enter into the consideration. And I've been going to FOMC meetings since Greenspan, so a long time. And politics never entered that room. The digital piece was edited by Lisa Thomson."
19,Business,"The yard of a house in Chesapeake, Va., displays a sign opposing the construction of data centers. Ryan Murphy/WHRO hide caption CHESAPEAKE, Va. — The two dozen or so nondescript gray, white and blue buildings lining Virginia State Route 625 could be large warehouses. But community activist Elena Schlossberg can identify them literally a mile away by their telltale rows of backup diesel generators. The buildings are data centers. ""We're sort of that model of how not to do this kind of development,"" says Schlossberg. All internet data goes through facilities like these: massive, sometimes multistoried warehouses filled with servers where every webpage and shred of data lives. Demand for these centers has skyrocketed in the last two years as artificial intelligence usage has gone mainstream. Virginia is a data hot spot. It has the world's highest concentration of data centers — nearly 600 facilities of varying sizes, including roughly 150 of the largest kind, known as hyperscale data centers. Not all residents are happy about that. As data centers have cropped up alongside residential developments, they have become synonymous with intensive power and water consumption, as well as round-the-clock noise from cooling systems. A decade ago, Schlossberg learned Amazon Web Services was building a huge data center, the equivalent of more than seven football fields, next to her home in Northern Virginia, and she threw herself into stopping it — unsuccessfully. ""And the data industry came and crushed us,"" she said. Amazon is one of several companies that have made Northern Virginia an epicenter for data: 13% of the world's data center operational capacity is here. And the demand for data is growing with the proliferation of AI applications like ChatGPT. There are plans for 70 more data centers in Virginia, many the size of multiple football fields. If built, they'll consume so much power that the state's main utility company, Dominion, is contracted to build 40 gigawatts of new energy capacity for these new centers — that's nearly three times the state's current maximum power production. ""To increase it by 40 gigawatts is to almost triple our entire grid for one industry … and to do that for one industry is absolutely unprecedented,"" said Julie Bolthouse of the Piedmont Environmental Council, a Virginia environment nonprofit. Dan Diorio, the vice president for state policy at the national Data Center Coalition, a trade group that represents developers and operators behind the centers, said the centers support everything people do online, from the banking app on your phone to storing electronic medical records to running 911 call centers. And the need for them is only growing. ""The data center industry is building out as quickly as they can to meet that growth and provide the digital services that we all rely on every day. And so far, we're still behind,"" Diorio said. Diorio said regulation of future data centers should balance residents' worries with the economic impact of development — $24 billion in capital investments in Virginia just last year. ""Not every project is the same, but I think as an industry we're responsive and responsible members of the community when proposing these projects [and] working to address those community concerns,"" Diorio said. Concerns about power and land use, as well as the cost of these data centers, have galvanized not just those worried about the environment but also a widespread not-in-my-backyard movement against them. And Schlossberg has become the go-to person for how to organize. She reels off the places she has gotten calls from: ""I've talked to people in Boardman, Oregon; Peculiar, Missouri; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Maryland; Georgia."" One of those places is Chesapeake, in Virginia's coastal southeast. Residents of this city of 250,000 learned of a proposed data center project just weeks ago, and they were concerned. Helen Messer's Chesapeake house backs up to a small water-retention pond. On the other side of that pond, a couple of hundred feet away, is the proposed data center site. She's most worried about the possibility of constant noise from the center's cooling systems, which typically run around the clock to keep servers from overheating. ""How am I going to relax with something buzzing at me 24/7?"" she asked. Within days of the proposal going public, Chesapeake residents held a meeting at a church social hall to prepare their resistance. A representative from the state's Sierra Club chapter answered questions about data centers elsewhere as residents worried over water usage, pollution and, of course, noise. The developer behind the data project, Doug Fuller, also showed up. He got a less-than-warm welcome from residents, including Messer. ""Why can't we move the data center to your neighborhood?"" she shouted, to a smattering of applause. Fuller pushed back, arguing the facility would be a net positive for Chesapeake. ""As a developer, I'll create an asset for our city. Tax revenues will be in the millions of dollars,"" he told an unconvinced crowd. Fuller also said his effort would help capitalize on a major government investment. For the last couple of decades, cities and counties in southeastern Virginia have struggled to diversify their economies away from tourism and shipbuilding. In the last couple of years, several of these municipalities got together and spent tens of millions of dollars on high-speed fiber-optic networks in hopes of attracting high-tech businesses like data centers. Chesapeake resident Lee D'Amore helped lead the charge against a proposed data center, including blanketing nearby neighborhoods in ""No Data Center"" yard signs. Ryan Murphy/WHRO hide caption Still, hundreds of Chesapeake residents implored local leaders by email and in person to deny the proposal. Resident Lee D'Amore, who lives a few blocks from where the data center was proposed, put up red ""No Data Center"" signs around his neighborhood ahead of a City Council meeting in June. ""Once they're built, there's nothing you can do. There's nothing you can do. If they violate the decibels, what are you going to do? Fine them $1,000? That'd be like me asking you for a penny. Seriously, once this thing is built, it's all over but the crying,"" D'Amore said. D'Amore and the rest of the anti-data center opposition showed up in force to the council meeting, speaking one after the other against the data center for more than two hours. ""I think there are viable areas this could go in our city and could flourish in our city, but I don't think anything near a residential area is [viable],"" Chesapeake City Council Member Amanda Newins said ahead of the vote. Dozens of opponents of the proposed data center in Chesapeake packed a City Council meeting there in June. Meg Lemaster, one of the organizers of the resistance, shows off stickers opposing the project. Ryan Murphy/WHRO hide caption When the tallying board lit up to show a unanimous vote blocking the data center, the council chamber erupted with cheers. Messer and her neighbors were giddy as they poured out of city hall. ""I'll sleep better than I have for a month,"" she said. As resistance has mounted nationwide, more data center projects are being delayed or outright rejected — 16 projects nationally between May of last year and this past March, according to a study by Data Center Watch, a research project run by 10aLabs, an AI intelligence company. But a central tension remains: The use of AI applications is skyrocketing. And the data centers to handle all of that have to go somewhere."

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images hide caption White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holds up a copy of a letter to Japan, signed by U.S. President Donald Trump, announcing 25% tariffs beginning on August 1st. It's been over three months since President Trump announced very big across-the-board tariffs on imports from nearly every territory on Earth–including uninhabited islands. It's a move he said would revitalize the U.S. economy. Since that splashy White House announcement, the tariff rates have been a wildly moving target. Ratcheted up - then back down - on China, specifically. Overlaid with global product-specific tariffs on categories like automobiles and copper. Partially paused after the stock market tanked. Through it all, the tariff rate has remained at or well-above 10 percent on nearly every good imported to the U.S. And if you've listened to NPR's reporting since April, you'll have heard many voices make one particular prediction over and over again – that American consumers will pay the price. If American consumers are going to pay for the tariffs, the question is: when ? For sponsor-free episodes of Consider This, sign up for C onsider This+ via Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org .

22,Business,"President Trump speaks to reporters during a meeting with Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images hide caption President Trump says he hasn't ruled out firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who he's been frustrated with for months for not lowering the interest rate. The Fed has been cautious about interest rates as it assesses the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation. Consumer prices were up 2.7% from a year ago — a larger annual increase than the month before. But Trump says Powell refusing to lower rates is hurting the economy. Trump told reporters Wednesday he's ""not planning"" on firing Powell -- a move that could undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. But he later said he hadn't ruled out firing Powell, saying it would be highly unlikely unless there was an instance of fraud. ""He's a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed,"" Trump said, even though he  nominated Powell as chair during his first term. But the president continues to send mixed signals. Trump said that he floated the idea of firing Powell to some Republican lawmakers on Tuesday and received support from them. A senior White House official who spoke on the condition of an anonymity tells NPR that Trump indicated to the lawmakers that he will fire Powell soon. Trump caused a wave of speculation and market uncertainty in April this year when he posted, ""Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!"" Days later the president said he had ""no intention of firing him."" The White House has also blamed Powell for an ongoing multibillion-dollar renovation of the Federal Reserve offices. Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, sent a letter to Powell on July 10 stating there were ""serious concerns"" about the project and asking for details on the planned expenses. Powell has said the president doesn't have the power to fire him under the law before his term ends next May. In November, he said he would not step down even if Trump asked him to do so. Powell also does not set interest rates unilaterally, and instead leads a board that works together and votes on those decisions."
23,Business,"Content creator Kira Abboud shows off ""Rich Auntie Outfits"" in a recent post on her Instagram account. Kira Abboud hide caption It's an unexpected place to spot a recession indicator — from videos reviewing the latest in skin care to picturesque posts of summer vacations — but the impact of turbulent financial markets and seesawing tariff policies threatens to upend the multibillion-dollar influencer industry for millions of online creators. Recession jitters have made online audiences and brands more discerning about their spending, possibly roiling the traditional income streams that influencers have come to rely on. ""It really does beg the question of what do creators do if the economy isn't there to support them?"" Sam Ogborn asks. Ogborn is a content creator and marketing strategist who has worked with brands like Red Bull and Walgreens. ""If they're so reliant on fans to buy from them and support them, what happens when that starts to go away?"" Posts sharing luxury handbag collections or exotic vacations were once popular on TikTok and Instagram, but now influencers are facing backlash in their comment sections for what some followers see as excessive displays of wealth during an economic downturn. It comes as a majority of Americans say they feel ""stressed"" or ""concerned"" about their finances, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll . Over half (54%) said they feel the economy is doing poorly. And it has impacted what audiences want to watch online. Peyton Knight, a marketing executive at Ladder and founder of Last Digital, which assists companies in managing their social media presence, says the financial anxiety has contributed to a decline in trust between followers and content creators. She says, ""The consumer is what really dictates what's happening in the market. And I think the consumer has pushed back and said, 'Enough.'"" Despite influencers' ability to harness their followers' buying power to promote a business or sell out a product with a single post, as recession fears grow, consumers' confidence in their spending power declines, causing brands to recalibrate. This year, nearly 76% of brands are dedicating advertising funds to online creators. That's a 10% decrease since 2024, according to Influencer Marketing Hub . Only 12% of those brands said they plan to allocate more than half their budgets to influencer marketing, a 12 percentage-point decline since last year. Knight explains, ""Where brands may have used 20-plus creators on a particular campaign, now on average [they are] using single digits for their influencer campaigns, just depending on the scale."" Are we in a recession right now? Economists are divided. mikroman6/Getty Images hide caption Skirt length. Men's underwear. Cardboard box sales. For generations, people have looked for small, informal signs that a recession is coming or already here. Nearly 12 million people in the U.S. consider themselves full-time influencers, according to one study, earning an average of $178,000 a year, a number boosted by the earnings of mega-influencers like Addison Rae and MrBeast. However, economic stressors and increased scrutiny from online audiences could cause the industry — and incomes — to shrink. Knight believes that the inability of some influencers to innovate as monetary support from brands dries up will cause the decline of what she calls the ""one-hit wonders"": ""Some people just have their moment and then they go away. They try, but they don't become the next Doechii."" But the influencers who have staying power will survive, she says. ""These people actually create the content I want to consume, that is, in some way, shape or form, is bettering my life or making me interested in a topic."" Ogborn encourages influencers to take an unconventional approach to weathering the storm by looking at how brands reacted during the 2008 recession . ""If I were a smart creator, that's what I would be doing right now — is studying what that looked like and starting to understand how behaviors shifted, instead of scrambling to figure out what to do next. Because creators at the end of the day are brands,"" Ogborn says. For some influencers, it may mean pivoting their content away from shopping hauls and more toward embracing underconsumption. Ogborn says as consumers want to buy less and save more, ""it makes sense that a lot of people now watch that kind of content and find ways to be scrappy in their own lives, because they don't want to just buy a new item anymore and pay the cost of the tariff."" A recent Instagram post from content creator and former model Caralyn Mirand Koch . Caralyn Mirand Koch hide caption For many influencers who grew up during the 2008 Great Recession, financial turbulence is nothing new. They remember the housing crisis, banks failing and the feeling of economic unpredictability. Yet content creators Kira Abboud and Caralyn Mirand Koch , who remember that time well, remain hopeful about the future of their industry despite the feelings of instability. Mirand Koch, a lifestyle and fashion creator who has over 400,000 followers on Instagram, says she tries not to operate from fear, but instead remains adaptable, ""whether that means shifting partnerships, or fine-tuning my content mix, or just leaning deeper into what my audience is asking for. Whether it's more lighthearted humor or more lifestyle content and not just necessarily so focused on selling."" Diversifying, Mirand Koch says, has been key to her success: knowing that social media platforms can come and go, but that ""you still want to have your roots and your core of who you are and where your community can find you."" For her, it has meant growing her audiences on other platforms like TikTok and Pinterest, as well as promoting her website. Abboud, a fashion and styling creator who has over 600,000 followers on Instagram and over 200,000 on TikTok, also encourages creators to look inward and work to better understand where their followers are emotionally and financially during this uncertainty. She says it's important for her community to feel secure, whether it's by offering clothing at lower price points or promoting more local brands: ""I need to think about what my consumer is doing, so I can give them what they need so they do feel as though their buying power is with me."" While there is uncertainty of what the future will look like for creators and their followers, for Mirand Koch one thing is clear: ""The only constant is change, and you just have to constantly be open-minded and adapt to what's happening — which is a scary place to be comfortable with."""
0,Climate,"Experts say there are key questions parents and guardians should ask camp operators about wildfires, flood and heat risk. Danielle Villasana for The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption The deaths of at least 27 children and staff at Camp Mystic in Kerr County, Texas have some parents and guardians questioning the safety of summer camps, especially as global warming increases risks of extreme weather. Part of summer camp's allure is that children are outside in nature. But that can also raise the possibility of heat illness and risks from greater proximity to wildfire or flood-prone areas, says Tracey Gaslin,  chief executive of the nonprofit Alliance for Camp Health in Kentucky. Outside of regulations that apply to all businesses, there are no federal standards that are specific to camps, says Henry DeHart, interim chief executive of the American Camp Association (ACA). The ACA has a national accreditation program that includes some health and safety standards, but it's voluntary and only about 12% of the country's roughly 20,000 camps have participated, he says. On the state level, DeHart says some state agencies conduct camp health and safety inspections. But oversight and protections vary considerably from state to state, and some states have very little regulation. ""There are a lot of states that have very little or no regulation related to camp,"" DeHart says. ""The regulatory framework is wide and varied and, in some places, it's not very robust."" Because of the gaps in the current regulatory framework, some experts on climate-related risks say parents and guardians should ask more detailed questions about campers' safety. Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers , dropped off his 8-year-old daughter at Girl Scout Camp earlier this month, and realized he, too, had many more questions about his daughter's camp's flood precautions. ""Even as a floodplain manager,"" he says, ""I don't think I even had appreciation for what, as a parent, I should be thinking about when sending kids to camp."" Now, Berginnis has a list of points to cover. For parents or guardians sending children to any kind of camp, here are the top questions experts say you should be asking about increased risks of heat, wildfires and floods. Camps can be great for kids, but can also expose them to heat. Children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies. Serhii Bezrukyi/Getty Images hide caption This question is important because heat-related illness and death are major and growing risks in the U.S. —and that threat is often underestimated. Also, children and teenagers' developing bodies aren't as good at regulating their body temperatures as adult bodies, says Rupa Basu,  senior science advisor for the University of California, San Francisco Center for Climate Health and Equity . That makes them more at risk for heat illness, she says. ""I  think that people don't even think of children often as being high risk populations,"" Basu says. "" But they absolutely are."" For these reasons, Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health thinks parents and guardians should be asking camps how they are thinking about heat and hydration. She suggests parents and guardians ask about how the camp's physical site is designed. "" Do you have things like shade structures? Misting systems?"" Gaslin says. ""A really solid infrastructure build is important."" Gaslin also thinks parents and guardians should be asking about how ""climate-aware"" the campers' schedules are. That can look like an activity in a cool location, then an activity outside in a warmer location, then back into the cool, she says. Also it's important to ask about how frequently counselors are reminding campers to hydrate. ""It's really about giving conscious thought to how do we manage that impact of heat,"" she says. "" If we're gonna be outdoors, guess what? Water activities are a great thing to do."" Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP hide caption This question is key because many camps are located in flood-prone areas, Berginnis says. He says – in many ways – that's understandable. ""To me, it makes logical sense that you'd have a lot of camps there because it has really interesting habitats. It has interesting animals and geology and everything, and kids can learn a lot there,"" Berginnis says. But he thinks parents and guardians need to know if their kids' camp is in a floodplain, and what the camp is doing about it. Berginnis says adults can look up risks on this FEMA website . Parents and guardians can also plug in addresses to this database from First Street , a climate risk modeling company. If it's a sleep-away camp, Berginnis says it's important to ask where the kids' sleeping quarters are located. ""If it's an overnight camp, any kind of residential lodging overnight for the kids, if it's in a floodway, that should be a huge red flag right there,"" he says. And he says parents and guardians should ask camps about things like flood sirens and specifics of emergency action plans. "" I would be very blunt with a campground: I wanna know the procedure. If a flash flood warning is declared for the area, what does the camp do? What do the counselors do? So that they can talk it through with you,"" he says in an email. ""Do not be satisfied with a generic answer like 'we have an emergency action plan'. Ask them about specific actions like is there anyone monitoring the weather at night? What are the designated evacuation areas? And if they cannot talk that through with you, again, I would say, that's another red flag."" Tracey Gaslin at the Alliance for Camp Health says parents and guardians should make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images hide caption As with flood risks, parents and guardians should be asking about emergency action plans and preparedness for wildfire and smoke, Gaslin says. ""Parents can ask camps, do they monitor air quality?"" she says, ""What's their evacuation plan? How are they gonna communicate with families? So families are gonna be able to say, in a moment of crisis, I wanna be able to communicate with you in some way."" Gaslin says it's important to make sure that all camp emergency action plans are regularly updated and reviewed by local emergency partners, including emergency medical staff. Gaslin says parents and guardians should make sure there are always staff monitoring the weather, and at sleepaway camps there should be a solid communication system so at night, individuals are alerted to environmental changes or concerns. That means at least some staff with cell phones and radios at all hours, to monitor for wildfire risk, flash floods, or any other hazards."
1,Climate,"People swim in the Blanco River by a low water crossing on River Road across from 7A Ranch in Wimberley, Texas, on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption WIMBERLEY, Texas — On a hot and humid mid-July afternoon, cars rumble down the streets of downtown Wimberley. Visitors browse Western-themed shops boasting vintage cowboy boots, cacti and local wine. Fourth of July banners blow in the wind, lining a bridge spanning a small creek that trickles through town. People float on inner tubes in the nearby Blanco River, sipping beers and splashing in the water. Ten years ago, this area was practically unrecognizable. On Memorial Day weekend in 2015, the Blanco River suddenly rose more than 40 feet in the middle of the night, swelling to about a quarter of a mile wide in some places and carrying away nearly everything in its path. At least 12 people were killed, including several children, and hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, according to local authorities. Since then, the small town of roughly 3,000 has focused on rebuilding itself with a potential flood like that in mind, installing new safety measures and alert systems with financial help from the state. But residents and government officials say that the recent deadly, destructive flooding in nearby Kerr County earlier this month has reinforced the need for more preparedness in flood-prone areas like Wimberley. It's also reopened old emotional wounds that still hadn't fully healed. ""It's really hard for us to watch the news right now, because it's just so eerily similar to what we went through that night 10 years ago,"" says resident and business owner Natalie Meeks. Natalie Meeks, co-owner of Water's Point Resort, said that she and her husband are constructing this building to be 3 feet higher than the updated flood maps for the area. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption She and her husband run a vacation resort along the Blanco River, which has been in his family for nearly a hundred years. Today, the river is calm, down a bank and a few hundred feet away from the nearest cabins. But during the flood, Meeks says those cabins ended up 20 feet under water. She and her husband woke up in the middle of the night to phone calls and alerts from people upriver, and rushed to the cabins to pull guests out — in some cases, physically carrying them — trying to find higher ground as the property was swallowed by the river. Loading... ""The only light source we had was lightning and transformers blowing,"" Meeks remembers. ""All you could hear was the ancient cypress trees just snapping, and the river just wasn't stopping."" She says they could hear houses being carried down the river, the people inside screaming for help. There was nothing they could do. All 100 guests and Meeks' family survived that night, but the water washed two of the cabins away. The rest of the structures were severely damaged. Meeks says it took nearly a year just to clear debris after the flood. Since then, it's been one project after another. On the far end of the Meeks' vacation resort, a cabin built on stilts engineered to withstand the rush of future flood waters is in the middle of construction. ""Even after seeing the aftermath of the flood, I didn't comprehend how much time and money it would take to rebuild. It's overwhelming,"" Meeks says, noting that it's not just about the physical rebuilding. ""It's emotional for a long time. It's just a long, long process."" This area in central Texas has long been known as Flash Flood Alley. Droughts cause rivers to run nearly dry for months, sometimes years at a time; heavy rains then make them suddenly overflow. Locals know that floods are part of life; often, they welcome the rain to replenish the water in swimming areas popular with tourists. But so-called 100-year-floods have been happening more frequently , as climate change is driving more intense rain storms across much of the U.S., dropping more water in shorter periods of time. This month's disaster in Kerr County has some of Wimberley's residents thinking about the possibility of another flood in their area, says Mayor Jim Chiles, who was not mayor at the time of the 2015 flood but has been since May 2024. Jim Chiles, mayor of Wimberley, Texas, is photographed at the local Dairy Queen on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Mayor Chiles says he has already had talks with city leaders about putting flooding infrastructure and safety front and center, specifically looking into an audible, citywide alert system like sirens, something many communities in the area are talking about as the death toll from Kerr County's floods has hit at least 130. Many think that might have helped save lives, especially when flooding happens in the middle of the night. ""It's all very premature, but we had an agenda setting meeting,"" he says. ""We put something on there to talk about sirens. Sirens are very expensive, and we gotta figure out how to do that."" He says he's hopeful the state will step in to help with it. Ten years after the 2015 Memorial Day flood in Wimberley, Texas, the Water's Point Resort is in the construction process for replacing the last cabin on the property to be lost during the flood. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption After Wimberley's flood in 2015, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott transferred $6.8 million from a state disaster contingency fund for statewide floodplain management, as well as more river gauges, which monitor the level of the water and send real-time information to weather alert systems. Wimberley's then-mayor Steve Thurber secured several new  gauges for the town, which only had one before the flood and was swept away during the storm. Since then, three have been installed upriver, allowing for much more accurate monitoring. But securing more funding will likely be difficult. Kerr County tried for years — and ultimately failed — to find a way to pay for a new alert system, including sirens. And now, prospects are even more limited, as the Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions of dollars dedicated to help rural communities prepare for disasters. Seventy-seven year-old Jim Venable has lived in Wimberley for most of his life, and while he hopes more infrastructure for flooding and alerts will be put in, he's not optimistic. ""Well, it's always about the dollars, right? You know, how much are the people worth?,"" he says. Jim Venable, 77, a construction superintendent in Wimberley Texas, poses for a portrait at the Wimberley Visitor Center on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Venable was a construction contractor nearby in Austin before the flooding. But afterward, he quit that job to focus on rebuilding Wimberley. ""I think there's still a lot of PTSD after the fact,"" he says, adding that over the Fourth of July weekend, as Kerr County flooded, residents in Wimberley were on edge. ""We're just looking at the rain, and we're just going, well, is that going to hit here or what's going to happen?"" Wimberley sits in Hays County, one of the fastest-growing counties in both Texas and the U.S, according to recent census data . In the summer, the population booms as it welcomes tourists and seasonal summer residents alike, according to town officials. The town is just 40 miles from Austin, making it a popular vacation spot for city dwellers. Venable says he welcomes the extra people coming to enjoy the town, but their presence highlights an even greater need for flood protections. ""We keep inviting people to come in, but we've got to protect them and take care of them, because we're apt to get these storms anytime,"" he says. Gabrielle Snyder, visitor services coordinator with the City of Wimberley, poses for a portrait at the Wimberley Visitor Center on July 9. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Gabrielle Snyder works as a visitor services coordinator for Wimberley's tourism department. She says since the flooding in Kerr County, she's had tourists call, concerned about upcoming trips to Wimberley. ""You want to be sympathetic and supportive, but we weren't affected by these latest floods,"" she says. She says part of her job is telling visitors about the need to sign up for flood alert systems and participate in emergency preparedness. But she has to walk a fine line, because the town wants — and needs — people to come. ""Obviously, Wimberley knows better than a lot of communities how devastating this situation is, but at the same time, you know, Wimberley is open,"" Snyder says. A ""Wimberley Strong"" flag flies at the Village Store in Wimberley, Texas, on July 9. The flag was created after the 2015 Memorial Day flood, which killed at least a dozen people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption Her house flooded back in 2015, forcing her, her husband and her daughter, who was 9 years old at the time, to quickly grab what they could and evacuate. It was a rental property, and the damage was so severe that it was eventually torn down. For a time, they lived in an RV borrowed from a friend, until they bought a home in a different part of Wimberley — with one major requirement. ""Never again will we live on the river,"" Snyder says. After witnessing what a powerful flood can do, she says she's fine with appreciating the river from a distance."
2,Climate,"In the coming months, there will be ""a 'hurry-up-and-buy' 'limited-time-offer' kind of dynamic"" to get government incentives for home solar and other energy-efficient technologies, says Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America. Mario Tama/Getty Images hide caption If you've wanted to install rooftop solar panels or buy an electric vehicle in recent years, you've probably been able to get federal money for them in the form of tax credits. But those incentives are going away now that President Trump signed what he's called the "" One Big Beautiful Bill "" into law on July 4. That means in the coming months there will be ""a 'hurry-up-and-buy' 'limited-time-offer' kind of dynamic"" to get these government incentives, says Ari Matusiak, CEO of the nonprofit Rewiring America . ""If you want to access them, then really you need to get going,"" he says. Here's what you need to know about what's happening to federal tax incentives for everything from solar panels to heat pumps to electric vehicles, and how much time you have to get that federal money. The country's first major climate policy under the Biden administration secured at least a decade of federal tax incentives for rooftop solar panels, solar water heaters and geothermal heat pumps, says Sean Gallagher , vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association. These technologies not only reduce climate pollution, they also make energy bills more affordable. Scientists say that solar energy plus batteries, as well as energy-efficient appliances, are all reliable technologies that can save households money. Despite the evidence, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers wrote in an email to NPR, ""Instead of subsidizing unreliable energy sources at the expense of hardworking taxpayers, President Trump is unleashing American energy to lower costs to provide further relief for businesses and families."" The tax credit meant homeowners could get up to 30% off the cost of installation or equipment . That tax incentive goes away Dec. 31. Matusiak suggests that people sign a contract with a contractor and pay for and install the project before the end of the calendar year so that they can secure their eligibility for the tax credit. Solar project installation can take a few months and some contractors can have long wait times. That's why he suggests talking to a contractor as soon as possible. If people are buying efficient heat pumps or installing home solar, experts suggest signing a contract with a contractor and paying for and installing the project before Dec. 31 to secure eligibility for the federal tax credit. Tristan Spinski for The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption In addition to the 30% off investments in things like home solar, a federal incentive called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit will also disappear later this year. That credit meant up to $2,000 off heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or biomass boilers on your tax bill. To qualify, appliances must have a high efficiency rating. Some manufacturer websites list tax credit-eligible equipment, as does the Energy Star Product Finder . The tax credit also offered up to $1,200 off home upgrades like new insulation, doors and windows. To qualify for this tax credit, it's not enough to just purchase the equipment. They must be ""placed in service"" during the calendar year — another reason Matusiak suggests moving quickly. Dealers are scrambling to sell qualifying EVs on their lots before the tax credits disappear. ""This is going to be the best time to buy an EV in a long time,"" says Pat Ryan of the car-buying app CoPilot. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Currently, some electric vehicle buyers are eligible for a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for buying or leasing a new EV, and up to $4,000 for a used vehicle. That money is available as a cash rebate at the time of purchase and can be used as a down payment. (Not every buyer and not every vehicle qualifies. You can read more about these credits here .) The new law ends those credits after Sept. 30, over the protests of auto dealers, who said such a rapid change will be disruptive. Rogers at the White House wrote in an email to NPR that ending the tax incentives will ""lower costs and incentivize Made in America products."" Dealers are now scrambling to sell qualifying EVs on their lots before the tax credits disappear. ""This is going to be the best time to buy an EV in a long time,"" says Pat Ryan of the car-buying app CoPilot. ""But, of course, that will go away when prices effectively go up when the rebate ends."" The nonprofit research group Resources for the Future says that its modeling suggests EV sales as a share of the total U.S. market could contract by a third with the end of the credits. That doesn't mean the end of the EV industry, analysts say. ""Automakers have spent literally billions of dollars building out supply chains,"" says Joseph Yoon of the auto data company Edmunds. ""I don't think it's just going to turn around and say, 'Oh, well, that was a fun little experiment.'"" But it could significantly reduce the pace of EV adoption and, as a result, lock in decades worth of future carbon pollution from the gas-powered vehicles being sold today. EV tax credits do boost EV sales, but they require a high government expenditure for each additional sale they encourage; some economic research has suggested that putting money toward chargers is a more cost-effective policy approach. The Trump administration has been working to roll back charger funding, too. The tax-and-spending package will end a credit available to businesses and individuals to help with the costs of installing EV chargers, specifically in low-income or rural areas. That credit, which covers 30% of the installation cost, will end June 30, 2026. Separately, the Trump administration has also frozen funding to build high-speed EV chargers on highways, a move that some states are currently challenging in court . Some local utility companies offer incentives for technologies like heat pumps, residential solar, or insulation, so experts suggest checking in with your local utility. The country's major climate legislation in 2022 gave more than $8.5 billion to states, including Arizona, Georgia, New York and Wisconsin, to help them expand or establish rebate programs for home green technology upgrades. Much of that money is still available. Rewiring America and another nonprofit called The Switch is On have online tools that can help people, in most states, plug in their ZIP codes and incomes to search for the federal, state, local and utility company incentives for which they're qualified. Consumers can also check for incentives at an online database from the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center . Still, because a lot of state rebate money is tied to Biden-era policies, experts also suggest looking into those sooner rather than later. Lowell Ungar , head of federal policy at The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization, doesn't think most states will run out of rebate money this year, but he adds, ""eventually they will run out of money and then there won't be any further federal help."""

Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images hide caption A search and rescue team looks for people along the Guadalupe River near a damaged building at Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas. It's not just Texas. In the past couple of weeks, communities all around the country have been hit with torrential rains and deadly flash flooding. Extreme weather events like this are expected to become more common as the planet heats up. As climate change increases flash flooding risks, our infrastructure is struggling to keep up. But improvements to that infrastructure will cost billions. NPR's Michael Copley explains how a changing climate drives flooding and how communities and individuals can prepare. And NPR's Laura Sullivan reports on how flood maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency didn't capture the true risks at Camp Mystic, which was devastated by the Texas flooding.

4,Climate,"Workers on scaffolding repaint the NASA logo near the top of the Vehicle Assembly Building in 2020 at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. John Raoux/AP hide caption The Trump administration on Monday took another step to make it harder to find major, legally mandated scientific assessments of how climate change is endangering the nation and its people. Earlier this month, the official government websites that hosted the authoritative, peer-reviewed national climate assessments went dark. Such sites tell state and local governments and the public what to expect in their backyards from a warming world and how best to adapt to it. At the time, the White House said NASA would house the reports to comply with a 1990 law that requires the reports, which the space agency said it planned to do. But on Monday, NASA announced that it aborted those plans. ""The USGCRP (the government agency that oversees and used to host the report) met its statutory requirements by presenting its reports to Congress. NASA has no legal obligations to host globalchange.gov's data,"" NASA Press Secretary Bethany Stevens said in an email. That means no data from the assessment or the government science office that coordinated the work will be on NASA, she said. On July 3, NASA put out a statement that said, ""All preexisting reports will be hosted on the NASA website, ensuring continuity of reporting."" ""This document was written for the American people, paid for by the taxpayers, and it contains vital information we need to keep ourselves safe in a changing climate, as the disasters that continue to mount demonstrate so tragically and clearly,"" said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. She is chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy and co-author of several past national climate assessments. Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's library and the latest report and its interactive atlas can be seen here . Former Obama White House science adviser and climate scientist John Holdren accused the administration of outright lying and long intended to censor or bury the reports. ""The new stance is classic Trump administration misdirection,"" Holdren said. ""In this instance, the administration offers a modest consolation to quell initial outrage over the closure of the globalchange.gov site and the disappearance of the National Climate Assessments. Then, two weeks later, they snatch away the consolation with no apology."" ""They simply don't want the public to see the meticulously assembled and scientifically validated information about what climate change is already doing to our farms, forests, and fisheries, as well as to storms, floods, wildfires, and coast property — and about how all those damages will grow in the absence of concerted remedial action,"" Holdren said in an email. That's why it's important that state and local governments and every day people see these reports, Holdren said. He said they are written in a way that is ""useful to people who need to understand what climate change is doing and will do to THEM, their loved ones, their property and their environment."" ""Trump doesn't want people to know,"" Holdren wrote. The most recent report, issued in 2023, found that climate change is affecting people's security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority communities, particularly Native Americans, often disproportionately at risk."
5,Climate,"Rescuers carry a boat into the subway in Zhengzhou, China, in July after flash floods trapped passengers underground. STR/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Rescuers carry a boat into the subway in Zhengzhou, China, in July after flash floods trapped passengers underground. Global warming is driving dangerous and disruptive flooding in underground rail systems around the world. Flooded tunnels and stations have disrupted service and stranded passengers in Boston, London, San Francisco, Taipei, Bangkok, Washington, D.C., and a host of other cities in recent years. But the problem has taken on added urgency this summer, with multiple, high-profile subway floods driven by summer rainstorms. Overnight, the remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded much of the New York City subway. Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a travel ban and warned residents to ""stay off subways"" as up to 10 inches of rain fell in some parts of the region in a matter of hours. It is the third time New York's subways have flooded this summer and the first time the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency warning for the city. Heavy rain has also repeatedly swamped underground tracks in Boston . Our infrastructure is not ready for climate change, a thread from tonight. 28th St. subway station pic.twitter.com/uYemJKB8yg Elsewhere, subway floods have turned deadly. In July, 13 passengers died in Zhengzhou, China, after flash floods trapped them. Harrowing videos showed people struggling to breathe a shrinking pocket of air as the water rose. ""None of us had seen people with water up to their necks, standing in underground trains,"" says Slobodan Djordjevic, an engineer at the University of Exeter who specializes in flooding of underground train systems. Djordjevic has spent much of his career studying floods in subway tunnels. But he says what he saw happening in China shocked him. ""I actually considered whether this was even real."" In China and around the world, the culprit is climate-driven torrential rain. Zhengzhou received about a year's worth of precipitation in just one day. Earlier this summer, the remnants of a tropical storm dumped a month's worth of rain on New York City in the span of an afternoon. Dozens of subway systems around the world have experienced flooding, Djordjevic says, and he estimates it's likely hundreds of thousands of passengers have been directly affected. That has created tension between the need to provide reliable, low-emissions mass transit options and the growing cost of maintaining underground transit in a wetter world. Keeping water out of tunnels and stations is expensive, especially in places with aging, leaky subways built for a 20th century climate. Some help could come from the federal government. The infrastructure bill moving through Congress allocates $66 billion for rail — a huge infusion of cash that could help fund retrofitting of old subway systems to keep water out and the building of new train lines in places that currently depend on cars. ""Every city should have a comprehensive review of flood risk for the underground system,"" Djordjevic says. ""Looking ahead, authorities need to think very carefully about where they want to build new lines, new stations, new tunnels."" Many U.S. cities are a decade or more into adapting their subway systems to a wetter climate. In Boston , the transit authority has started waterproofing stations and protecting tracks that are vulnerable to sea level rise. After Hurricane Sandy flooded miles of subway tunnels, New York poured millions of dollars into flood control for the nation's largest underground rail system. In Washington, the transit authority has spent millions of dollars waterproofing leaky tunnels and plans to spend even more to keep water out of vents and station entrances. ""We are investing more in water mitigation today than we ever have,"" says Andy Off, executive vice president of capital delivery for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The authority also has an emergency flood response. A unit tracks inclement weather so that flooding hot spots can be monitored and workers can put out sandbags and check underground pump stations before the water arrives. But keeping the water out is a constant battle. Much of Washington metro system was built nearly 50 years ago, and the subways in New York and Boston are even older. Air vents are flush with the sidewalk or street, which makes it easy for water to flow in. Many station entrances are in low-lying places or are constructed in ways that funnel water from the street down stairs or escalators. ""Older systems were designed for the climate of the past,"" says Tina Hodges, a former analyst at the Federal Transit Administration who wrote a 2011 report about climate risks to public transit in the United States. ""In the Northeastern United States, which is home to some of the oldest and largest transit systems in the country, there's already been a 67% increase in the heaviest precipitation."" The same is true in many European cities, including London and Berlin. In recent years, passengers have captured strikingly similar videos of water cascading into subway stations in cities thousands of miles apart. Newer subway systems in flood-prone parts of Asia may offer clues about how to adapt. As this summer's disaster in Zhengzhou made clear, Asian cities are on the front lines of climate-driven subway flooding. And the fact that those newer systems are often better protected from flooding and fatalities underscores the urgency of adaptation. Water runs down the steps of a subway station in Berlin in 2019. Cities in the U.S. and Europe are racing to waterproof older subway systems as climate change drives more rain. Fabian Fuchs/picture alliance via Getty Images hide caption ""There's a lot to learn from Asian cities, ways to deal with flooding of underground trains,"" Djordjevic says. For example, in Taipei, where flooding from cyclones is common, Taiwanese authorities raised the entrances to stations to keep water out. In Kyoto, Japan, researchers built a full-scale model of a subway station escalator and simulated a flash flood to see how much water people could safely walk through and to help create emergency plans for closing stations during storms. Bangkok has long had a flood warning system to keep passengers safe, although the city has struggled to prevent underground train flooding. Many subway systems in Asia were also built more recently than their counterparts in the U.S. and Europe, so they are better-suited to the current climate, Djordjevic says. In the U.S., larger cities are generally doing a better job adapting to and preparing for transit flooding than smaller ones because they have more resources, Hodges says. For example, large transit departments increasingly employ resilience experts who work full time on adaptation and can also collaborate with climate scientists and engineers to come up with solutions that protect trains and passengers from flooding. Smaller cities are less likely to have such resources. ""There are definitely barriers to adapting to climate change, one of which is that it's just difficult to interpret the information that comes in from climate scientists into actionable information that planners and engineers can use,"" Hodges says. Commuters head into New York's Third Avenue-149th Street subway station on Thursday. Heavy rain from remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded much of the city's subway system. Authorities issued a travel ban and warned residents to avoid stations. David Dee Delgado/Getty Images hide caption Commuters head into New York's Third Avenue-149th Street subway station on Thursday. Heavy rain from remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded much of the city's subway system. Authorities issued a travel ban and warned residents to avoid stations. The benefits of underground trains still outweigh the costs for many cities. Since Hurricane Sandy, New York has pressed forward with subway line expansions. San Francisco is expanding its subway, even as the system faces flooding from sea level rise. Fort Lauderdale, Fla., one of the most flood-prone places in the country, is considering a new underground train line that would reduce car traffic and allow residents to commute into the downtown area by train. Investing in new underground infrastructure in a city known as the ""Venice of America"" has raised some eyebrows. The editorial board of the city's paper spoke out against the plan and argued that the train should cross a major river in the city via a bridge, rather than a tunnel. But while Mayor Dean Trantalis acknowledges that climate-driven flooding is a worry in his city, he dismisses concerns about train tunnel flooding. ""If you put in the proper pump stations and the proper technology to anticipate heavy rainfalls and things like that — I've lived in Fort Lauderdale for almost 40 years, and I've never once seen our tunnel flooded,"" he says. And keeping the train underground will alleviate traffic congestion caused by railroad crossings, Trantalis says. Experts say it's important that new infrastructure take into account the costs of maintenance and the climate of the future. Sea level rise is accelerating in many places, including Florida. If new train systems are designed to last 30 years or more, they will need to withstand dramatically higher tides as well as more frequent and severe storms. ""When it comes to coastal areas or parts of Florida, sooner or later sea level rise will lead to some areas that need to be abandoned or protected at a very, very high cost,"" Djordjevic says. ""So those decisions would need to be looked at very carefully."""
6,Climate,"A view of high-voltage transmission towers in Houston. The law President Trump signed on July 4 ends tax incentives for wind and solar projects and is expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., according to a nonpartisan think tank. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption The law that President Trump signed on July 4 ending tax incentives for wind and solar projects is expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with some of the sharpest increases in Republican-led states, according to Energy Innovation , a nonpartisan think tank. Without tax credits, the cost of wind and solar plants will go up. Companies are likely to respond by building fewer of those projects, and those facilities that do come online will have bigger price tags, according to multiple estimates. As that happens, the country is expected to generate more electricity from natural gas plants, which are often more expensive to run than wind and solar projects. That shift will hit hardest in states that don't have their own policies to drive renewable energy development , says Dan O'Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation. In Oklahoma , for example, homeowners, renters and businesses are likely to see electricity rates shoot up by between 60% and 350% over the next decade, according to Energy Innovation. The firm expects rates to rise by at least 48% in Kentucky , 39% in Missouri and 30% in Kansas . The congressional delegations of those states are overwhelmingly Republican . ""In a world before the bill, you would have a lot of cheap renewables"" built regardless of state policies, O'Brien says. ""But after the bill, there's nothing making sure those keep coming on, so you're seeing a lot more expensive gas generation."" A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that Trump has taken steps to boost U.S. energy production. ""The One, Big, Beautiful Bill will turbocharge energy production by streamlining operations for maximum efficiency and expanding domestic production capacity, which will deliver further relief to American families and businesses,"" Rogers said. At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump called wind and solar energy ""a blight"" on the country. ""They hurt our country very badly,"" he said. ""And smart countries don't use it."" A view of a solar plant in Richmond, California. The cost of solar and wind projects has fallen dramatically. In the U.S., these industries have been helped for decades by federal tax incentives. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption Renewable energy was the top source of new electricity generation globally last year, with much of it installed in China, according to the International Energy Agency . ""Chinese leadership does understand how big a problem climate change is. They're getting hurt by climate impacts,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. But, he says, ""once you get into it, you're like, 'Oh, wait a minute — this just makes economic sense.'"" The cost of wind and solar projects has fallen dramatically. In the U.S., those industries — like the fossil fuel sector — have also been helped for decades by federal tax incentives. ""Wind is a critical part of our nation's all-of-the-above energy strategy,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who calls himself the ""father"" of the wind-energy tax credit, said several years ago when wind farms became his state's biggest source of electricity. ""It creates thousands of jobs, supports economic development, boosts tax receipts, attracts investment in our state and puts extra money in farmers' pockets."" But for years, renewable energy executives and advocates have debated when and how to get off subsidies. Those discussions ramped up when the incentives were threatened by Congress, says Paula Mints, founder and chief analyst at SPV Market Research. ""I think we've become complacent, dependent on these tax credits, and I think we need to finally phase them out,"" Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures, said this month as the Senate debated cutting the incentives as part of the tax-and-spending bill. However, the industry urged lawmakers to unwind the tax credits gradually to give companies time to adjust. What companies have gotten instead is chaos. ""I would characterize this as a high degree of volatility expected over the next year,"" says Ryan Sweezey, director of North America power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research firm. ""I mean, the policy situation is still not clear."" Under a deal struck by Republican senators, wind and solar projects are eligible for tax incentives as long as companies start construction within the next year and finish within four. That timeline was in the bill that Trump signed on July 4, setting up a scramble for companies to begin working on as many projects as possible. But that was upended last week when Trump issued an executive order that directs the Treasury secretary to consider issuing new guidance for what companies have to do to meet the government's ""beginning of construction"" standard. The goal is to keep companies from circumventing tax laws, according to the order. Now, companies that build wind and solar projects are trying to figure out whether investors are going to put their deals on hold until they know what the administration will do, says Keith Martin, a lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright. ""This Trump era is like trying to do business while bouncing up and down on a trampoline,"" Martin says, adding, ""It's very hard to do business in that atmosphere."" President Trump signs his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House on July 4. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption The moves have thrown America's wind and solar industries into turmoil at a time when electricity demand is expected to increase significantly for the first time in decades. Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to help power new data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap . Those wind and solar plants will get more expensive when tax incentives disappear, potentially changing companies' investment decisions. New power generation in the U.S. is expected to fall by about a third over the next decade, mainly due to wind and solar projects that won't come online, says O'Brien of Energy Innovation. While renewables are technically the cheapest source of new power generation , even without government subsidies, that doesn't account for the cost of tying intermittent resources into the power grid. As more wind and solar comes online, investing in things like batteries becomes more important so that electricity can be delivered when it's needed. At the same time that activity in the renewables market is expected to slow, a shortage of gas turbines will prevent companies from building more natural gas plants than they had already planned to bring online in the next five years, according to Energy Innovation. ""We're already running our cheaper gas generation facilities a lot in the U.S.,"" O'Brien says. ""And we have more capacity. We can dip into that in more hours. But those are the generators that cost more per hour to run."" Operating those plants could get even more expensive as gas demand rises. The U.S. Energy Information Administration already expected prices for the fuel to increase , mainly due to demand from facilities that export liquified natural gas around the world. ""The timing here is not great,"" says Sweezey of Wood Mackenzie. Under the law Trump signed this month, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall by 25% by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, according to an analysis by the ZERO Lab at Princeton University and Evolved Energy Research. That's little progress from where the U.S. is now. Gary Hershorn/Corbis News via Getty hide caption While electricity rates are expected to skyrocket in some states, Energy Innovation says costs are likely to rise across the country. Nationally, rates will increase by 9% to 18% on average by 2035, the firm says , and the U.S. will lose out on billions of dollars in planned investment and hundreds of thousands of jobs. Renewable energy manufacturing could get hit especially hard. Companies that have opened U.S. factories to make solar panels and other components have said abruptly unwinding clean energy tax incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector. The tax credits that are being eliminated encourage companies that build power plants to buy American-made products, like solar panels and other components. The U.S. will also cut less of the climate pollution that's contributing to more intense storms, floods and wildfires. Under Republicans' new tax-and-spending law, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are expected to fall by 25% by 2035 compared with 2005 levels, according to an analysis by the ZERO Lab at Princeton University and Evolved Energy Research. That's little progress from where the country is now. Last year, emissions were about 20% below 2005 levels, according to the Rhodium Group , a research firm. Under Biden-era policies, emissions would have fallen by at least 40% from 2005 levels by 2035, researchers at the ZERO Lab and Evolved Energy Research said. ""I don't think subsidizing electricity just as a general matter necessarily makes sense,"" says Noah Kaufman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Joe Biden. However, tax incentives for clean energy were extended during the Biden administration ""as part of a broader strategy,"" Kaufman says, ""to address climate change and to better prepare the U.S. energy system and economy for the global energy transition."" ""Now,"" Kaufman adds, ""I think it's fair to say the Trump administration doesn't share either of those goals."""
7,Climate,"A damaged home is seen after flash flooding in Hunt, Texas, on July 4. Just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Nearly every county in the United States has experienced flooding in the past few decades, but just 4% of homeowners nationwide have flood insurance, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency . It's what experts call the flood insurance gap . Most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flooding . And while FEMA aid may be available to help people repair their homes after federally declared disasters , it often covers just a fraction of the costs. That means when floodwaters come, people frequently are on their own to pick up the pieces. It's a reality communities across the country are facing after flooding hit parts of Texas , New Mexico and North Carolina in the past week alone. In all three states, the floods were caused by extremely heavy rainfall inland — a risk that's growing with climate change . A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. As temperatures rise, it's fueling more intense rainstorms that drop more water in shorter periods of time. One solution: Homeowners, renters and businesses can buy flood insurance, which most people get through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program , says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, which assesses property risks from climate change. Federal flood insurance offers up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for nonresidential buildings . People can buy policies that also cover the belongings inside their home, including clothing and furniture. The program is open to anyone who lives in one of the approximately 22,600 communities that have adopted certain standards to regulate development in their floodplains. Porter estimates that people living in more than 90% of U.S. counties are eligible. For people who want flood insurance but live outside of a qualifying community, they would have to go to the private market. ""It's clear that [flood] insurance protects property owners and it protects the communities,"" Porter says. ""It ends up keeping property values from dropping, post-event. It ultimately ends up keeping properties from going into foreclosure."" In some places, though, federal flood insurance is unaffordable for many residents, and costs are rising around the country. So, people ""roll the dice, hope [a flood] doesn't happen,"" says Brian O'Connell, an analyst at insuranceQuotes, an online platform where people can compare and buy insurance. ""And when it does happen — and we talk to people who it happens to — it's one of the worst things people ever experience in their lives."" Heavy rains from Hurricane Helene caused record flooding and damage last year in Asheville, N.C. As climate change raises global temperatures, it's fueling more intense rainstorms that drop more water in shorter periods of time. Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images hide caption The U.S. government created the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968 when private companies stopped offering coverage. The federal program, which is backed by taxpayers, has been chronically in debt, borrowing from the Treasury to pay claims. Several years ago, FEMA began overhauling how the flood program sets its prices . Now, premiums are based on a home's value, FEMA says, and the flood risk an individual property faces. That's a more granular approach than the government used before. FEMA says one of the goals is to encourage actions that reduce flood risks. As a result of those changes, the cost of federal flood insurance is surging in some parts of the U.S. In Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, for example, where 9 out of 10 homes are at risk of flooding , people are looking at paying more than $5,400 a year for flood insurance, an average increase of more than 500%. That's on top of their regular home insurance costs. ""The guy with a million dollar house, he'll figure it out,"" says Anderson Baker, a retired insurance executive in Louisiana. ""The guy with a $150,000 house, a couple hundred dollars extra a month, or $300 extra a month, that's a life-changing increase in his premium."" O'Connell of insuranceQuotes estimates a flood insurance policy is likely to cost around 30% to 75% of what someone already pays for homeowners insurance. There are companies that have started to offer flood insurance again, which creates some competition for the federal program, says Porter of First Street. However, private insurers only cover 12% of the market, according to First Street . For some people, taking on the added expense of flood insurance isn't much of a choice . Homes in high-risk flood areas that have mortgages from government-backed lenders have to have flood insurance. Properties that have received federal disaster aid in the past also must be covered by flood insurance to qualify for future assistance. And in Florida , the state-backed insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., has started requiring homeowners that have coverage for wind damage to also buy flood insurance. If a lot more people bought flood insurance, it would drive down the cost of coverage and could entice more private insurers into the market, says Michelle Osborne, director of the Risk Management Institute at Campbell University. But as things stand, the cost of flood insurance is often a dealbreaker for people, says O'Connell of insuranceQuotes, especially since many doubt they need protection. ""There's this misapprehension that if I'm not in a flood zone, then I shouldn't have to get flood insurance,"" says Baker, the retired insurance executive. ""But everybody's in a flood zone. People at the top of a mountain are in a flood zone. They're just in a good flood zone."""
8,Climate,"Homeowner Daniel Olivas walks through his home that was heavily damaged from flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, Texas, on Thursday, July 10, 2025. Many home buyers in the U.S. do not get information about flood risk before them move in. Gerald Herbert/AP hide caption In the wake of deadly flash floods in Central Texas, many people are wondering what they can do to protect themselves from flooding where they live. It's a good question, and one that is relevant to people across the United States. As the Earth gets hotter, flooding is becoming more common and severe in most of the country. More than 14 million apartments and houses have a substantial risk of flooding in the next 30 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office — from sea level rise and storm surge along the coasts, to heavy rain and river flooding inland. And, because the climate is changing, many places that flooded a little in the past will flood a lot in the future, putting lives and property at enormous risk. It's already happening: One-third of the federal disaster money distributed after floods goes to people who live outside official flood zones, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Yet, in many parts of the country, it is easy to move into a flood-prone building and not know you're in harm's way. Despite the risk, 14 states do not require that any information about flooding be disclosed to potential home buyers. So, what questions should you ask about flood risk before you move? And how easy is it to find answers? NPR talked to flood experts and put together this guide, a version of which was originally published in 2020. You can use it to find information whether you're planning to move soon, or just wondering about flood risk where you already live. Why should I ask this? Places that flood once often flood again, especially as the climate changes. Where to start Landlords or real estate agents may share information about past flooding, but in many places they are not required to do so, and the information you do receive may not be complete. You can check the laws for homebuyers in your state using this map from the Natural Resources Defense Council, although it does not include disclosure requirements for renters, which are more rare. Longtime residents and local media reports are often some of the best sources of information about past flooding in the area. Why should I ask this? The flood history for your building or neighborhood isn't enough information. What you really need to know is how sea level rise and more extreme rain are going to contribute to your flood risk in the future . The answer depends on how long you intend to live there. If you're buying a house using a 30-year mortgage, and planning to live in it for decades, you're much more likely to experience a flood at that address than if you're planning to rent the same house for one year. Some real estate sites, such as Realtor.com and Redfin.com, include flood risk in their listings. People in coastal areas can also look up their flood risk on the Climate Central Riskfinder . Some states and cities publish local information about flood risk, including Rhode Island's coastal management mobile app and Louisiana's coastal protection forecast . Contact your state's emergency management agency to see if such information is available for your area. FEMA publishes the flood maps that are used to set public flood insurance premiums. Many local and state governments also use them for planning. It's important to know your FEMA-designated flood zone, because you might need to buy flood insurance. But even if the FEMA map says you're at low risk, you might not be. Many FEMA flood maps are out of date, and even newly updated ones don't take into account climate-driven heavy rain or sea level rise. FEMA flood maps are publicly available and searchable online. Just put in your address here . Watch out: The map loads very slowly. Why should I ask this? Most renter and homeowner insurance does not cover flood damage. Instead, you may want to purchase a separate flood insurance policy to cover flood damage to your belongings, the apartment or house itself, or both. If you live in a flood-prone area, flood insurance can be expensive. If you're moving to a place that FEMA thinks is at lower risk, however, your insurance premium will be much lower. That could end up being a good deal: About 25% of the flood damage covered by insurance are outside the highest-risk areas. Flood insurance is sometimes mandatory. For example, if you buy a home in a high-risk area using a federally backed mortgage, or if you buy a house that flooded before and was rebuilt with federal disaster aid, you must buy flood insurance. In some states, including Louisiana and Texas, the seller is required to tell you if this is the case. In most states prospective renters or buyers don't have a right to know how much flood insurance will cost. FEMA provides the vast majority of residential flood insurance. However, the agency will not disclose to prospective buyers or tenants whether a property has a flood insurance policy, or how much that policy costs. You can still ask the landlord, previous tenant or seller whether they have flood insurance and how much it costs. You can also ask other people who live in the building or neighborhood, or ask a local insurance agent for a quote. Why should I ask this? In some places, landlords and sellers do not have to tell you much about flood risk, and usually they are only required to disclose information after you've made an offer or applied for a lease. Tenants generally have a right to much less information than buyers. The details vary by state. Where to start The Natural Resources Defense Council tracks state flood disclosure requirements for people buying homes. Why should I ask this? Some local governments are trying to move people out of the riskiest areas. One way to do this is to purchase homes that have flooded repeatedly and demolish them to make room for water to spread out harmlessly. This only applies to a small percentage of neighborhoods, but if your new neighborhood is one of them, you probably want to know before you move there.

9,Climate,"Texas officials are considering installing flood warning sirens along a section of the Guadalupe River in Kerr County that saw catastrophic floods on July 4. Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption In the wake of the deadly flash floods in Texas on July 4, Texas leaders are betting on the lifesaving potential of flood warning sirens. ""What can we do better looking forward? We need sirens,"" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick in an interview this week with NBC 5 in Dallas-Fort Worth. The floods killed at least 120 people. Weather warning sirens are installed outside on tall poles and make a loud wailing sound to warn people in the area when water levels rise, signaling an imminent flood. Some also broadcast spoken warnings and directions about how to get to safety. These types of sirens are widely used in the United States to warn people about tornadoes and tsunamis but are much less common in areas that flood. ""If you had sirens blasting,"" Patrick said, ""and if people had known 'if you hear a siren get to high ground,' maybe that would have saved some lives."" Patrick pledged that the state would pay to have flood sirens installed in Kerr County, the epicenter of the recent flooding, ""by next year."" There appears to be public support as well. A petition calling for flood warning sirens in Kerr County, on the website change.org , had garnered almost 40,000 signatures as of Thursday. Emergency experts say such sirens can save lives in places like Kerr County, where many people go to vacation outdoors and which is so prone to deadly flooding that the area is nicknamed Flash Flood Alley. ""Sirens are best for alerting people who are outside of a building,"" says Jeannette Sutton, an emergency warning researcher at the State University of New York at Albany, who has worked with both the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Weather Service. Sirens are very loud, she says, and work well in rural areas where people are spread out. ""[Sirens] are really going to get people who are camping along a river, which is a really good thing."" But sirens are just one piece of the puzzle, flood experts caution. Sirens often aren't audible inside, so cellphone warnings, social media warnings, and television and radio alerts are still crucial. Ideally, people will receive multiple different kinds of warnings. ""We've gotta meet people where they're at,"" says Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. ""To have redundancy in your approach is a good thing."" A search and recovery worker shines his flashlight through murky waters on July 6 in Hunt, Texas, two days after deadly flash floods tore through the area. Jim Vondruska/Getty Images hide caption Nearly a decade ago, in 2016, Kerr County considered installing flood warning sirens, says former County Commissioner Tom Moser. The county ultimately didn't pursue them because of opposition from residents. About 50 local residents attended a public meeting that year to discuss a proposal for a new flood warning system, he says, ""and there were people at that meeting that did not like the idea of sirens."" The main concern among residents was the potential for false alarms. ""Sirens going off in the night with a false indication, it would not be a good thing,"" Moser says. ""So we took those out of the plan, just because so many people were objecting to sirens."" Indeed, false alarms are a disruptive and potentially dangerous problem with warning sirens, according to a 2017 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a federal science agency. One way to avoid false alarms is to make sure the siren is triggered reliably, the report notes. For flash flood sirens, that means installing river gauges throughout the area so that water levels are monitored continuously and the sirens go off only when dangerous flooding is occurring, says Berginnis. Such gauges are an important part of any flood warning system, whether or not it includes sirens. Kerr County tried to upgrade its river gauges in the decade before this month's catastrophic flood. The county sought about $1 million in funding for an updated river gauge system and better flood warnings in places where local roads cross rivers. But they were turned down by state authorities . Sirens are only useful if people in the area know what to do when they hear the tone, emergency experts say. ""If they're just a noise that goes off, a lot of people won't know what they mean,"" explains Keri Stephens, a risk communication researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. ""What the research really stresses is we actually need to teach the people that these warnings are meant for, what they mean."" That could mean public service announcements, drills in schools and workplaces and explanatory signs in the most vulnerable areas that direct people to high ground, she says. In places that already use sirens for other hazards, such as tornadoes, flood sirens might be less effective or require more public education. Stephens says Japan offers a good example of such public education. The tsunami-prone nation has a system of warning sirens and teaches schoolchildren about what to do if they hear one. In a rural area that attracts tourists, such public education can be more difficult. People who are new to an area may not know what to do when they hear a flood warning siren for the first time. Some sirens can broadcast specific instructions, which can help. But they only work in some settings, and the words can be difficult to understand, says Sutton. But even if people don't know their exact meaning, sirens can still be useful, Sutton argues. For example, tourists camping by a river that begins to flood during the night might not know exactly what to do if they're woken up by a siren. But ""if it wakes people up at 3 in the morning so they're, like, 'Oh god, something must be happening!' and it makes them go look for information, then at least it gets them up and awake and moving,"" she says. It's unclear how many communities in the U.S. have flood warning sirens. But it is not a new idea in the Texas Hill Country, where the recent floods happened. The towns of New Braunfels and San Marcos , Texas, have had flood warning sirens for years. The town of Comfort, Texas, which is immediately downstream of hard-hit Kerrville, installed a flood warning siren just last year . In Maryland, the riverside town of Ellicott City installed sirens in 2019 after a pair of deadly flash floods. Flood warning sirens are more widely used in other parts of the world. Switzerland has a national network of flood alert sirens , including in rural areas that may not have reliable cell service. And some alpine communities in the Himalayas use sirens as part of their early warning systems for flash floods, which have historically been extremely deadly . Many of those sirens run on power from solar panels, so they operate even if a flood knocks down power lines, as happened in Texas. A worker installs flood warning sirens in western Germany in 2022, almost one year after the region was devastated by floods. Ina Fassbender/AFP via Getty Images hide caption But sirens do not guarantee that people will get to safety. In Germany, emergency sirens are used to warn residents about a wide variety of hazards, including floods. But catastrophic flash floods in 2021 still killed more than 200 people in Germany and Belgium, even though many warning sirens went off. Germany responded by upgrading warning systems across the country, to add river gauges and sirens capable of broadcasting specific directions for how to get to safety. Sutton says installing flood sirens more widely in the U.S. comes with challenges. ""They're very expensive to purchase and then they're expensive to maintain,"" she says. Most local communities cannot afford to pay for such a system on their own. And a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) program that was a major source of federal funding for such disaster infrastructure projects was canceled this spring by the Trump administration. Berginnis says not all flood-prone communities can afford, or need, sirens, but they all need robust plans for monitoring floodwaters and warning people when a flood is about to happen. ""I think the interesting thing about flood warning systems is everybody jumps to 'We need the most technologically advanced system,'"" he says. While sirens can help in some places, lower-tech solutions can also save lives, he stresses. ""In reality what you need is a good plan,"" Berginnis says. ""You need a battery-powered weather radio , and you need someone willing to stay up all night long to make sure the warnings are translated into action."" Edited by Rachel Waldholz"
10,Climate,"Vehicles sit submerged as a search and rescue worker looks through debris from the early July flash flooding in Hunt, Texas. Jim Vondruska/Getty Images hide caption What should you do in the face of a flash flood? The question is on the minds of many in the wake of catastrophic flooding in Texas, which has killed over 100 people and renewed scrutiny over state and federal emergency preparedness. While the July 4th floods broke records , Texas is not alone. Flash floods have devastated communities across the country in recent months, from the South to the Midwest . Flash flooding usually starts within three to six hours of heavy rainfall from hurricanes and thunderstorms, but can also follow a dam failure or melting ice. It can start with very little warning and escalate exponentially, with currents powerful enough to carry away cars and other debris. And climate change is making them worse , as a warmer atmosphere can drop more intense rain over shorter periods of time. Jonathan Sury, a senior staff associate at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Climate School, says the flooding in Texas — whose scope and speed caught many off-guard — is an example of a tragic trend. ""This is a warning sign, in a way, to many other communities, specifically in rural areas, that these types of events may happen and are becoming less rare,"" he says. Sury notes that the Texas floods are also one of a number of extreme weather events that happened in the middle of the night, while many people were asleep. Those include a string of deadly tornadoes that swept through Kentucky in May, and some of the wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles in January. This kind of overnight emergency, Sury says, ""requires a different level of preparedness and a different level of awareness."" Here's some expert advice for how to protect yourself from flash floods — a process that starts well before storm clouds appear. Sury says bracing for a weather event starts with having a solid household emergency preparedness plan. To make one, you first have to understand your level of risk. You can use tools from FEMA and First Street Foundation to figure out what flood zone your home is in and what that means for evacuating. For example: What is the closest higher ground you can get to, what route would you take and what areas might be susceptible to flooding along the way? Is there an attic or upper floor that people can move to without having to go outside? Where will your family members meet if they get separated? Once you have that plan — and share it with every member of your household — you should pack a go bag with things such as water, food, medications, laminated copies of important documents and phone numbers, cash, first-aid supplies, signaling devices and an ax. Sury recommends keeping a smaller, separate emergency bag in your vehicle too. ""Doing that preparedness well before something happens is what's really going to make people more at ease,"" Sury says. ""These events are very stressful and people are able to make better decisions in a time of crisis when they aren't fumbling around to find X, Y or Z."" The next step is to set up multiple ways of receiving weather alerts, and understand what different warnings mean. There is a nationwide emergency warning system that will ping your phone with weather threats (just make sure your phone settings allow you to get notifications), but you can also sign up for alerts from your local weather and news channels. You can also buy a physical NOAA weather radio , which broadcasts round-the-clock forecasts and warnings from the National Weather Service. Pay attention to the language of those alerts : A flash flood watch means conditions are favorable for one to happen, while a flash flood warning means flooding is imminent or already happening. ""The flash flood warning, when you see that, that's the time to really think about: How can I get to higher ground?"" Sury says. ""And if I'm in my car, how can I get to higher ground as well as not wanting to drive through an area that often floods?"" A couple waits for a rescue crew after their car got stuck in deep floodwaters in Windsor, Calif., in November 2024. Experts say you should break your window and climb out as quickly as possible. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Once a flash flood starts, experts say the main priority is quickly getting to higher ground, whether that's the top floor of a building, the roof of your house or the highest hill in the woods. If you evacuate your home, you should try to turn off your utilities and place valuables on the highest floor. And if you're outside — by coincidence or choice — you should never try to walk, swim or drive through the water. Flash floods can come on in minutes, and even small amounts of fast-moving water can be extremely dangerous, says Jennifer Horney, with the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. Floodwaters may also contain hazardous household chemicals, waste and debris. ""It only takes 6 inches of water to sweep away a person who's walking and only 1 to 2 feet to push away a car or a truck,"" Horney told NPR's Morning Edition . ""So even if you have that big SUV, don't try to drive through a flood."" The best advice , as the National Weather Service says, is to ""turn around, don't drown."" If you see a flooding or low-lying road, turn your car around and either pull over or drive in the opposite direction. If you do find yourself in a car taking on water, you should try to get out as quickly as possible . Undo your seatbelt and climb out through the windows before the car gets totally submerged. ""Losing your vehicle is much more easy to replace than losing your life,"" says Stephen Wood, an associate professor at Northeastern University's nursing school who has worked in emergency medicine. Wood — who once escaped a flash flood in the New Hampshire mountains — says everyone should have something in their car that can cut their seatbelt and break a window (you can buy ""car escape tools"" made for this). Aim for the corner of the window , which is the weakest part of the glass. If you do find yourself in the water, Wood recommends trying to float on your back and position yourself feet-first to take the majority of any impact from debris. If you hit or pass by something you can grab on to — like a tree — try to climb up and away from the water. He emphasized the importance of an evacuation plan and go bag, though said people should also be prepared to make decisions in the moment based on their surroundings: ""I think it's instinctive survival."" Once you're on higher ground, you can call for help — but keep in mind that even if your phone is working, you may not be the only one dialing 911. Standing on a roof or next to a car can make you more visible to first responders when they do show up. ""The good thing about the flash floods is that they tend to dissipate quickly, and there are special teams trained to rescue people in swift water situations,"" Horney said. It's important to avoided flooded roads even after a storm, as downed power lines and debris still pose risks. Mark Rightmire/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images hide caption Even after the storm passes , danger can persist. Wait for emergency workers to remove any downed power lines and debris, and for authorities to issue the all-clear , before returning back to your street, let alone your home. At home, check for things like damaged gas lines, cracked foundation and standing water to make sure it's safe to go inside. Wear protective gear, like goggles and sturdy shoes. Once inside, check to see how high the water levels got and whether they reached the height of electrical sockets — and if so, don't plug anything in just yet. Sury also recommends looking out for mold, which can live behind walls. You can hire experts to evaluate your home and any potential repairs. As NPR has reported , if your house flooded, you should take steps to dry it out immediately, including ripping up carpets and removing furniture. It's also crucial to take pictures of the damage of the inside and outside — especially the water levels — for insurance and assistance purposes."
11,Climate,"For years, Kerr County officials debated how to fund a flood warning system. Under Trump administration changes, disaster funding opportunities are getting more limited for communities. Desiree Rios for The Washington Post/via Getty Images hide caption Years before the flooding took more than 90 lives in Kerr County, Texas, local officials knew residents faced threats from rapidly rising water. They started planning a flood warning system, one that could alert residents when a flash flood was imminent. Still, like many other communities around the country, Kerr County struggled to find a way to pay for it. They turned to the largest source available for most localities: funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA has granted billions over the last five years to help communities prepare for disasters. The idea is one that has been proven on the ground: When communities invest in infrastructure and preparation before a disaster, it can dramatically lessen the damage when a disaster hits, as well as save lives. Kerr County's funding application was turned down by Texas officials in charge of administering the federal funds. As with most of FEMA's programs, there was more demand for money than was available. Kerr County looked into a Texas state grant program for flood projects, but gave up when they learned it would cover only a small portion of the cost. In Texas alone, more than $54 billion in flood projects are waiting to be built, and state legislators have only dedicated a small fraction of that funding so far. Now, funding prospects for communities at risk are getting even more limited. The Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions of dollars dedicated to help communities prepare for disasters. Trump signed an executive order saying states should be responsible for funding disaster preparedness, instead of the federal government. ""I think that's going to be a big gap to fill,"" says Christopher Steubing, executive director of the Texas Floodplain Management Association, which represents flood officials around the state. ""FEMA has a reason to be around and they need to be there. There's a lot of programs that they engage with and oversee that communities rely on."" In 2016, Kerr County officials noticed that communities nearby were putting in flood warning systems, designed to save lives. Thirteen people had died in extreme flooding in Wimberley, Texas in 2015. Kerr County faced the same risk. ""I think that this area is one of the highest probability areas for flash floods that exists, OK — probably within, I don't know, within the nation, but certainly within the state,"" Tom Moser said at a Kerr County commissioners' meeting in 2016 , while he was a commissioner. Officials knew that different sets of river gauges, which measure the height of the water, didn't feed into a centralized system. Some road crossings across the Guadalupe River didn't have adequate warnings. Other counties had installed warning sirens to alert residents when the river was flooding. The county put together a proposal for a flood warning system, though installing sirens was cut from the plan after pushback, including from one commissioner concerned about sirens going off in the middle of the night . The cost was just under $1 million. The county then looked to federal funds from FEMA, which were available in Texas through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program . That program offers money to areas with disaster declarations so they can rebuild and prepare for future disasters. Texas was granted federal funding after several flood disasters, including Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The funds are administered by the Texas Division of Emergency Management, but Kerr County was turned down twice by the state agency, according to transcripts of county meetings . Then, Kerr County, along with the Upper Guadalupe River Authority, looked to state funding. Texas had created a special fund for flood projects in 2019, known as the Flood Infrastructure Fund , which was seeded with $793 million. It offers loans and grants, though the grants still require local communities to pay for much of their projects. Under the state's grant formula, Kerr County would have had to cover 95% of the cost . Former Commissioner Moser says that was a dead end for the flood warning project. Current Kerr County officials did not respond to questions from NPR about why the flood warning project wasn't completed. ""Not having the funds to accomplish it was not very satisfying to me but we tried,"" Moser says. ""That's all we could do. We didn't have the resources in the county operating budget to do that."" In 2021, Kerr County did receive $10 million from the federal government, as part of Covid-related stimulus funds under the American Rescue Plan Act. Communities could use the funds for public health projects, or communications and infrastructure projects of their own choosing. Kerr County officials opted to spend the bulk of it on a new emergency communication system , providing more coverage across the county for police, firefighters and first responders. Search and recovery workers have spent days on the Guadalupe River after it rapidly rose more than 20 feet in a flash flood. Jim Vondruska/Getty Images hide caption Kerr County's funding struggle is common. Many communities across the country don't have the funds needed to build large flood control projects that could keep residents safer. The challenge is that those projects don't generate revenue, unlike a water supply project where cities can charge residents for the water itself. Instead, communities have to consider raising local taxes to pay for flood control projects. Moser says that was a nonstarter in Kerr County, since taxes were rarely raised during his time as a commissioner. Tax increases are politically arduous across Texas. ""Those always kind of get shunned upon in this state most of the time,"" Steubing says. Given that large flood projects can cost tens of millions of dollars, FEMA's new funding programs over the last five years were a game changer for many communities. They marked a key shift for the agency: Instead of just paying for damage from disasters after the fact, helping communities become more resilient before disasters occur could save lives and reduce damage and costs. Now, the Trump administration has canceled the $4.6 billion program , known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC). The cancellation includes grants that were already awarded to communities across the country. Other funding specifically for flood projects, under the Flood Mitigation Assistance program, has been frozen . Trump has said he wants to eliminate FEMA as the agency exists today and has directed state and local governments to take a larger role in preparing for disasters, ""thereby saving American lives, securing American livelihoods, reducing taxpayer burdens through efficiency, and unleashing our collective prosperity,"" according to the executive order . Steubing says his association of flood managers supports making FEMA's programs more efficient, since applying for grants and doing the required technical analyses can be out of reach for many smaller communities. Even for those with the capacity to apply, it can take many tries. ""Typically, you've got to make a run at it two times or so,"" Steubing says. ""There's always a bigger demand out there than they ever put funding available."" Still, losing federal funding will leave a large hole, he says. In 2024, Texas released its first-ever statewide plan for addressing flood risk, finding that 1 in every 6 people in Texas lives or works in a flood hazard area. It also found that local governments aren't able to handle the projected $54.5 billion in costs for flood projects . Up to 80% to 90% would need to come from state and federal sources to complete the projects. Texas' state flood fund has awarded almost $670 million to projects so far, but the fund can be challenging for some communities to access. It offers zero-interest loans, which communities must still pay back, or a grant for a portion of the flood construction project. Still, under the state's grant formula, communities like Kerr County only get 5% of the cost covered. ""We've actually talked to them about making that more of a grant opportunity and enlarging that piece, still requiring community assistance, but then just making it a little more accessible to a lot of the parts of the state,"" Steubing says. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has directed state legislators to consider programs to improve flood warning and preparedness in an upcoming special legislative session. Even if Texas were to construct all the needed flood projects, climate experts say it wouldn't fully protect residents. That's because many projects don't take climate change into account. In a hotter climate, rainfall has already gotten more intense in Texas. Still, many communities use outdated rainfall records to design their projects and calculate what kind of storms they should endure. In Harris County, where Houston is located, flood officials analyzed whether rainfall had gotten worse and found that extreme storms that used to drop 13 inches of rain now drop 17 inches of rain. That added millions of dollars to their construction costs, since the flood projects needed to be engineered to handle more water. ""The past used to be reliable for engineers to depend upon to predict the future, but with climate change, you can't do that,"" says Jim Blackburn, co-director of Rice University's Severe Storm Prevention, Education and Evacuation from Disasters Center. ""I think that, in a nutshell, is one of the biggest problems we're facing throughout the country."" Blackburn says as storms continue to get more extreme, Texas will need to rely more heavily on other strategies to protect people, like relocating residents out of dangerous floodplains or expanding natural wetlands and floodplains around rivers so floodwaters have somewhere to go. ""We keep repeating the same pattern,"" Blackburn says. ""We get flooded. Homes get destroyed. We rebuild the homes where they are. Maybe we elevate them a little bit. Maybe we make them stronger, but we keep replicating the same pattern of development."""

13,Climate,"Debris covers over tree limbs after flooding near the banks of the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, Texas on Tuesday, July 8. Ashley Landis/AP hide caption A former commissioner of a flood-ravaged Texas county says a siren warning system would have saved lives and that he believes state officials will act promptly to implement a warning system. Tom Moser, who served as Kerr County commissioner from 2012 to 2021, told Morning Edition he advocated for a flood warning system with sirens in 2016 after a deadly flood in nearby Wimberley. That system was never built because commissioners were denied funding from state grants and there was public pushback. Locals were concerned about the more than $1 million price tag. ""People did not like the idea of sirens throughout the county,"" he added. The central Texas floods killed at least 109 people over the Fourth of July holiday weekend and left more than 160 missing. Many of them are children, most of whom were attending summer camp. Questions have loomed since the floods about what emergency plans were in place. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says investigations into storm preparation and response are likely to begin later this week, as state lawmakers prepare for a special session to address the disaster. Moser says state and local officials are likely to act on implementing more effective warning systems now after the most recent disaster. ""I think it will be more robust, more reliable, more effective. And I don't think it's going to take very long to do,"" Moser said. ""Probably a couple of years at most. At most, a few million dollars, not billions, but a few million dollars to do it. And it can be done."" NPR's Michel Martin spoke with Moser about what the county and state can do to prevent loss of life during future severe weather events. The following excerpt has been edited for length and clarity. Michel Martin : Do you think that the county could have done more to warn and protect people? Tom Moser : Well, let me answer it this way. The county has an emergency management plan which delineates exactly what to do in case of a flood. And it tells who's responsible for what and who's supporting what. So I'm sure that — I don't know this factually — I'm sure they followed that emergency management plan. So I wouldn't have any comment beyond that. Martin : Earlier this year, the state legislature failed to get a bill out of committee that would have created a statewide funding mechanism for sirens and emergency alerts. And I'm wondering if you think that this tragedy, as terrible as it was, is going to spur them to reconsider that? Moser : Well, in a positive sense, on this tragic thing, I think it will happen. I think it will be more robust, more reliable, more effective. And I don't think it's going to take very long to do. Probably a couple of years at most. At most, a few million dollars, not billions, but a few million dollars to do it. And it can be done. We're going to do it and use all the current technology that exists and blend those technologies together to give a very, very effective early warning system. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, front, speaks during a press conference on Tuesday, July 8, after touring damage from flash flooding in Hunt, Texas. Eli Hartman/AP hide caption Martin : I want to mention, though, you have extensive experience in product management. You were a project manager for NASA for some like two decades now. Do you think there are other measures that could prevent a similar tragedy in the future, since you had a lot of time to think about it? Moser : I think there's technology that exists today. There's topographical maps that are digitized that can be used to identify and characterize the terrain. There's ways to predict currently and and with more precision what we think rainfall is going to fall. And then with models, you can determine where the rainfall is going to be and where it's going to go and what the levels are going to be downstream. I think that's the thing that exists today that didn't exist in the past. And believe it or not, use artificial intelligence to bring all that data together and help guide the direction of which alarms should be sent. Martin : I do have to ask, though, if you feel that had this warning system been built, that lives might have been saved. Moser : Yes, if the sirens were there, from what I know, just listening to the media and hearing it. I'm not there. I haven't been involved in, you know, the rescue or the day to day things that are going on right now. But yeah, I think if sirens were there, clearly people would have known about it. Would it have saved everybody? No, I don't think so. I think this was an event that's probably one chance in a million of happening. Martin : So I just wanted to ask what thoughts you have now about what else needs to happen going forward. And it's also a difficult question to ask because people love this area and they love their homes. And there's so many memories that people have attached to these areas. But do you think that people should consider relocating? Moser : Well, I don't think they should consider relocating. I think they should consider where they're building in proximity to rising water. Develop the system that I just delineated a while ago and — those are tools that can identify flooding in a particular area — make that same tool available all over. But use the same analytical capability to build a system and use it to integrate and use the same information that exists wherever it is throughout the United States. And I think that would benefit everybody. And it's not a huge expense and it can be done very quickly, I'm convinced. This web story was written by Destinee Adams and edited by Olivia Hampton.

14,Climate,"Volunteers clean up a house after flooding in Kerrville, Texas. The state's governor and top emergency official are on a board considering options to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, at the request of President Trump. Ashley Landis/AP hide caption In the wake of the deadly floods in Central Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott praised President Trump for quickly approving a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, the hardest-hit area. ""The swift and very robust action by President Trump is an extraordinary help to our response,"" Abbott said. The declaration unlocked federal money to assist with the disaster response. That includes paying for debris removal, for search and rescue experts who are working around the clock, and for housing, food and other immediate necessities for those who lost homes in the floods. But such assistance may not be available in the future. President Trump has proposed eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which provides billions of dollars in assistance to communities hit by disasters. He argues that states should take on more responsibility for responding to and preparing for extreme weather and other disasters. Texas leaders are helping Trump realize that goal. This spring, the president appointed a council of Cabinet members, governors and emergency management experts, tasked with recommending changes to FEMA. Gov. Abbott and the top emergency official in Texas, W. Nim Kidd, are both on that council. ""FEMA is slow and clunky and doesn't solve the needs of those who need it the most,"" Abbott said at the first meeting of the FEMA Review Council in May. ""States have proven that we can move more nimbly, more swiftly, more effectively."" Now, as Texas responds to catastrophic floods, the officials leading the state's efforts will also be considering how to reshape, or even dissolve, the country's top disaster response agency. The president has suggested that the federal government should have a much smaller role in responding to disasters. But it's unclear what that means in practice. Trump said in June that FEMA will provide less disaster-related funding to states overall. Bloomberg news reported that an internal agency memo confirmed that FEMA leaders were considering changing policies to make it harder for states to receive funding after disasters. FEMA spends about $45 billion each year on disaster relief nationwide. At the first meeting of the new FEMA Review Council, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, said she supports lump sum payments wherein states receive large disaster recovery block grants from the federal government, rather than tailored reimbursements and grants to cover specific damage. Kidd, who leads the Texas Division of Emergency Management, agreed that the distribution of disaster-related federal money should be simplified, and pointed out that his state agency routinely works with dozens of federal offices and agencies. Kidd also suggested that states should take more responsibility for training emergency experts, from emergency management courses for high school students to community college and university degree programs. Other members of the review council suggested shrinking FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program, which provides the majority of residential flood insurance in the U.S. FEMA has already canceled billions of dollars in grants to help communities prepare for extreme weather, for example by upgrading stormwater pipes to handle more water or install warning systems for wildfires and floods. The cuts come as climate change causes more frequent and intense weather across the country, including flash floods, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires. And many emergency management experts and state disaster response officials say that FEMA plays a crucial role that state governments cannot fill . Responding to and recovering from the largest disasters requires too many people and too much money for most states to handle on their own, they say. Members of Congress have proposed a different approach to reforming FEMA: increase the agency's focus on disaster preparedness, and make funding easier to access. A bipartisan bill making its way through Congress would simplify the process for disaster survivors to apply for federal assistance, and remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security, giving the agency a direct line to the president. Lawmakers say the goal is to make it easier for communities and individual disaster survivors to get help quickly. Right now, it can take months or even years for federal money to arrive in hard-hit places. That bill would also incentivize states to invest more in disaster preparedness by tying state spending to federal aid after a disaster. A second bill , introduced by Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., days before the Texas floods, would make it easier for rural towns to get FEMA assistance and access federal money to prevent damage from extreme weather. As far as the president's stated goal of getting rid of the agency in its current form, only Congress can eliminate FEMA completely. But the executive branch can act on its own to restructure or reduce the size of the agency. Edited by Rachel Waldholz"

Heavy rainfall caused severe flooding along the Guadalupe River in central Texas, leaving dozens reported dead. Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption In an aerial view, the sun sets over the Guadalupe River on July 06, 2025 in Kerrville, Texas. Heavy rainfall caused severe flooding along the Guadalupe River in central Texas, leaving dozens reported dead. Imagine standing in water shallow enough to just barely hit the soles of your feet. And then it rises so fast that in just about ten minutes, it's up to your neck. That's how fast the Guadalupe River in Texas rose last week, according to state officials. Twenty-six feet in less than an hour. That flooding left dozens dead, devastated homes and businesses. Officials, emergency crews and volunteers are hoping more survivors will be found. But in a press conference today, officials warned the death toll will continue to rise. In the Texas Hill Country, climate change and geography conspired to create one of the worst floods in generations.

16,Climate,"Debris, rubble and a damaged car in North Plainfield, N.J. on Tuesday, July 15, 2025 after flooding from heavy rains in the area. Climate change is causing heavier rain across the United States. Seth Wenig/AP hide caption Dangerous flooding has hit many communities across the United States recently. On Monday evening, water gushed into subways in New York City, and roads flooded in New Jersey after a series of thunderstorms dumped rain on the region. Last week, flash floods tore through a mountainous area in New Mexico and rain from Tropical Storm Chantal flooded roads and homes in North Carolina. And crews are still searching for the bodies of victims after catastrophic flash floods in Texas , where up to 12 inches of rain fell in the early hours of July 4th, according to National Weather Service radar estimates . In every case, the flooding was caused by extremely heavy rain. Climate change is driving more extreme rain storms across much of the U.S., which drop more water in shorter periods of time and make dangerous floods more likely. On Monday, more than 2.5 inches of rain fell in New York City, setting a new record for the most rain to ever fall on July 14th. When a large amount of rain falls very quickly, the ground can't soak up the water. In the New York metro region, that led to flooded subway stations and even water in trains, as well as inundated roads. And flooding from heavy rain can be deadly, particularly if the terrain is even a little bit hilly. That's what happened in Texas earlier this month. Water was funneled into low areas, picking up speed as it flowed downstream. This caused dangerous flash floods, as the water rose quickly and moved swiftly. The part of Texas that flooded is known as Flash Flood Alley, because of its impermeable limestone hills and frequent downpours, but these floods were unusually severe for the area. And climate change is making such floods even worse. That's because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. That extra water vapor means storms can drop more rain than in the past. Today, the heaviest rainstorms in Texas drop about 20% more water than they did in the late 1950s, when the planet was significantly cooler, according to the National Climate Assessment . And extreme rain in Texas is expected to get much more frequent in the coming decade, as the climate warms even more, according to a 2024 report by the Texas state climatologist. Across the U.S., the heaviest storms are projected to drop more rain as the planet continues to warm. Loading... We don't know yet how much climate change contributed to the recent storms. An initial analysis of the Texas floods by a group of European climate scientists estimates that climate change may have caused slightly more rain to fall during the July 4 storm. Scientists will be able to do more accurate analyses as more detailed data from Texas become available in the coming days and weeks. The rain in Texas was particularly intense because the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry were moving over Texas after the storm made landfall last week in Mexico. As the Earth warms, tropical storms and hurricanes are dumping more rain than they used to. Most of the excess heat that humans have trapped on Earth has been soaked up by the oceans, and warmer ocean water combined with warmer air in the atmosphere makes large, wet storms more likely . Such storms can cause deadly flooding very far inland, a phenomenon that was on full display last year when Hurricane Helene caused devastating flooding in Appalachia. In 2021, flash floods from the remnants of Hurricane Ida killed dozens of people in the Northeastern U.S., after making landfall in Louisiana. More than one third of the estimated $230 billion of damage caused by inland flooding in the U.S. between 1988 and 2021 would not have happened without human-caused climate change, according to the National Climate Assessment . The flash floods in South Central Texas washed out roads and bridges, and swept away buildings and RVs along the Guadalupe River. Despite the growing risks, many communities around the country are still not planning for more intense rainstorms as they build roads, floodways and storm infrastructure. That's in part because local governments around the country rely on historical rainfall records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to plan flood control systems. But in some places, the records are decades old , meaning they don't reflect how rainstorms have already gotten more intense in most of the country. In Texas's Harris County, which includes Houston, NOAA updated the rainfall records in 2018 and found that extreme storms – those that have a 1% chance of occurring in any given year – now drop almost 18 inches of rain , compared to 13 inches prior to the 1960s and 70s. That increase meant that one-third of the major roads and highways in Harris County are vulnerable to flooding. To respond to the growing risk, the county's flood infrastructure plan became $150 million to $200 million more expensive , largely due to the flood safety needs. NOAA is currently updating outdated rainfall records nationwide , taking into account how climate change could continue to make storms worse. Those updates are expected to be released starting next year . NOAA did not respond to questions about whether that timeline is changing under the Trump administration. Trump has proposed significantly shrinking the agency , including programs that work on climate change research."
17,Climate,"A Texas Department of Public Safety official inspects debris on the waterfront at Camp Mystic along the banks of the Guadalupe River after a flash flood swept through the area Sunday, July 6, in Hunt, Texas. Julio Cortez/AP hide caption As the death toll rises following catastrophic floods in Central Texas over the holiday weekend, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, says officials owe a thorough investigation to find out what went wrong in warning and evacuating residents. Flash flooding in Texas killed at least 90 people over the Fourth of July weekend, with most reported in Kerr County, about two hours northwest of San Antonio. Many people in the county live along the Guadalupe River, which rose over 26 feet in 45 minutes early Friday morning when heavy storms started. In the days since, local officials have grappled with tough questions about why people who live along the river were not warned to evacuate. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned of possible heavy showers on Wednesday and upgraded Thursday to a flood watch, which is when conditions make flooding possible. A flash flood warning, meaning flooding is imminent or happening, wasn't declared until early Friday morning, after nearly a foot of rain had already fallen. In an interview with Morning Edition , Castro said it's imperative that the NWS be well-staffed and ready to work with local and state agencies in the face of climate change, particularly during emergencies like the one in Central Texas when flash flooding occurred quickly. ""I think we all owe that to the community there. And also, I think we owe that to the people of this country going forward to make sure that we do everything we can to prevent something like this from happening again,"" Castro said. Earlier this year, the NWS lost almost 600 workers after the Trump administration ordered cuts, which some critics warned would affect emergency preparedness. The agency recently began rehiring after public backlash about staffing cuts. The local Austin/San Antonio NWS forecast office listed at least six vacancies in recent days. On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed criticism that the federal response to the floods in Texas has been inadequate due in part to funding cuts. ""Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning,"" she said. Castro's district, the western half of San Antonio and Bexar County, is still recovering from flash floods last month that killed 13 people. From his experience, he says Kerr County will need state, federal and private support to recover from the floods Castro spoke to NPR's Leila Fadel about the floods and the lingering questions about the federal and state response. The following excerpt has been edited for length and clarity. Leila Fadel : Just as they did in San Antonio last month, hundreds of first responders have conducted water rescues, they're saving people who are stranded in trees and stuck in swamped vehicles. Are there enough local resources available to recover from disasters like this? Rep. Joaquin Castro : Kerr County is not the size of Bexar County where San Antonio is or Harris County like Houston. And so the tax base there is much more limited. It's a smaller community. So it's going to be important that both state and federal governments are very helpful and supportive with resources, with money for the community to rebuild, to look at alarm systems, to prevent this from happening again, to look at flood mitigation efforts as well. It's tragic in both cases. Both cases in San Antonio and in Kerr County were very different. In Kerr County, you had a situation where the river rose and you had structures and housing along the river. In San Antonio, it was a very urban situation where people were basically trapped in their vehicles with rising water in a flash flood very quickly. But it really speaks to the importance of having the resources, including the National Weather Service, to be able to warn people very quickly and move very quickly to combat flash flooding. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, speak at the Capitol on Jan. 23 in Washington. Rod Lamkey, Jr./AP hide caption Fadel : One of the big questions being posed to local officials, to state officials and to the White House is why people weren't warned earlier. Some of your colleagues in the Senate sent a letter to the president and the secretary of commerce last month, alarmed over the staff reductions at the National Weather Service and what that could mean for emergency preparedness. In your view, did these cuts play a role in preparations and warnings here? Castro : I think it's too early to know whether in this particular instance it did, but I think there should be a full investigation, not just of any kind of federal failures, but also state and local, obviously. I think we all owe that to the community there. And also, I think we owe that to the people of this country going forward to make sure that we do everything we can to prevent something like this from happening again. But I think it also speaks to the importance of the National Weather Service, that you have a full and robust staff that can work with state and local agencies to warn people. Because you're dealing with just a short period of time, with a flash flood, where you've got to get the message out to people right away. That means you need the personnel in place, you need the local government helping to warn people, and then you need a way to help people evacuate very quickly. And right now we still have a rescue effort going on, and finding the rest of those people alive, hopefully, is a priority. But after that, in the months to come, I think we owe it to everybody to make sure that there's a thorough investigation of what went wrong. Fadel : As you know, we're beginning to experience heavier and more extreme rainfalls. What most needs to happen now to try to prevent future loss of life in these weather emergencies? Castro : We need a strong National Weather Service. We need to strengthen the working relationship between the National Weather Service and state and local governments. We need to improve the warning systems, obviously. And, I know that for many years now, the idea of climate change has become a political one, it's become a very political debate. But these events that were supposed to be a one in a 100 year event or one in a 500 year event have been happening more often. So we have to take that issue seriously and combat it.

18,Climate,"A search and rescue volunteer holds a T-shirt and backpack with the words Camp Mystic on them in Comfort, Texas on July 6, 2025. The volunteer found the belongings yesterday along the Guadalupe River near Ingram, Texas. Danielle Villasana for The Washington Post / via Getty Images hide caption For Lauren Garcia, Camp Mystic, nestled on the banks of the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country, was a little slice of heaven. A place where she could disconnect from the outside world. Established in 1926, the private Christian summer camp became a tradition for generations of women in the state. Campers, who wrapped up their second year in school, participated in activities like horseback riding, canoe races and archery. But now, the historic campgrounds have become a site of mourning. In a statement released by Camp Mystic officials, 27 campers and counselors were confirmed dead in the flash flood that ripped through central Texas. Camp director Richard 'Dick' Eastland was among the dead. Rescue and recovery efforts are still ongoing along the Guadalupe River. Garcia, who attended Camp Mystic for a decade, first as a camper and then as a counselor, says the loss is deeply personal. ""My heart is broken,"" Garcia said in an interview with NPR's Michel Martin. ""We are leaning on each other, on our love, and the love that we shared at the camp."" This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Michel Martin: I understand your mom and her sisters all went and your sisters all went. What made it so special for all of you? Lauren Garcia: Oh, we loved it. It was a home to some of the most meaningful and lifelong friendships I've had. It's like a little slice of heaven there every summer to come back and see the familiar faces and fresh ones. I couldn't wait. Martin: What are some of your favorite memories? Garcia: I don't know where to start. It's rooted in tradition and ritual. Sundays were some of my favorites. We would all make our way down to the cool Guadalupe Waterfront for our Sunday devotionals. You could hear everyone's charm bracelets would jingle as we'd all sing together. We would learn lessons from the camp owners themselves, Tweedy and [Richard] Dick Eastland. They owned the camp, but it felt more like a family affair. They knew everyone's names and they would teach us things like how to be kind to one another. They would hand out these things called fuzzies to other little campers. We'd pass them to each other, just to recognize how to give love to one another... It was so special that their family was involved in everything from walking on the campgrounds and teaching us fishing. Their sons and daughters were program directors, head chef, head nurses. They ran the events and they made the most amazing food. Martin: We've heard about so many famous and not famous people who sent their daughters there. Laura Bush, the former first lady, was a counselor there. Why do you think it has had such a hold on so many people through so many generations? Garcia: It's hard to put into words unless you are or have a mystic girl. No amount of anecdotes could allow me to explain now how this place has been cracked open for the world to see. It was like a little bubble in a safe haven. No matter what was going on in your home life or your school life, you would come back each year and expect some of the same rituals and traditions. I think that's what girls like myself depended on. It brought calm and ease and it was just beautiful there. Martin: I can only imagine what you're feeling knowing about what happened at the flood. What kinds of conversations are you having with other former campers? What are you talking about? Garcia : My heart is broken. It was devastating for so many families. I can't even put that into words. I think this community needs each other. We are leaning on each other, on our faith and the love that we shared for this camp. That's what Camp Mystic taught us — to lean on each other. Physically, we're seeing people help out with recovery efforts and organizing massive donation drives. And for this unimaginable sorrow, we're staying connected through prayer and service. That's always what camp has been about. This interview was edited for digital by Majd Al-Waheidi."
19,Climate,"Trees grow against the windows at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025 in Oracle, Ariz., U.S. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption ORACLE, Ariz. — Plopped in the Sonoran Desert, just outside Tucson, Ariz., sits a massive, multilevel greenhouse that's probably best known as the inspiration for a Pauly Shore movie. A slick, stepped-glass pyramid climbs out of the dusty scrubland, next to a series of white geodesic domes. The building would be at home in a midcentury world's fair. But it's what's inside that's really eye-popping. Through a basement maze of whirring industrial equipment are mundane-looking doors that lead to the unexpected. A decades-old rainforest, soaked in humidity and teeming with plant life. A miniature manmade ocean, sloshing gently against a small shore. Not to mention the  mangrove wetland and fog desert landscape. The structure reaches 91 feet at its highest point, covers more than three acres and contains 6,500 windows. Part of the Biosphere 2 complex in the Santa Catalina foothills on June 20, 2025,in Oracle, Ariz., U.S. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption The Biosphere 2 complex including the living quarters, right, on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz., U.S. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption It's a living, breathing laboratory called Biosphere 2. Researchers created the facility in the late '80s and early '90s to see if humans could survive in an artificial, self-sustaining ecosystem. A group of eight people called ""Biospherians"" sealed themselves inside a terrascaped glass chamber for two years starting in 1991, where they farmed their own food, tended to livestock and ran experiments. But oxygen levels started dropping, in part because carbon dioxide was being absorbed by the concrete used throughout the massive structure and not turned back into oxygen by the facility's plants. The researchers' personal conflicts became international headline fodder, instead of the science. A second mission started in 1994 but only made it six months. The story of Biosphere 2, however, has evolved well beyond the late-night punchlines, tell-all books and the Pauly Shore movie Bio-Dome. Texas billionaire Ed Bass spent some $150 million building Biosphere 2. But after all the attention and scrutiny, Bass and his team decided that the focus should no longer be on people living on-site, according to Biosphere 2 Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Director John Adams. It was then leased to Columbia University, which used Biosphere 2 to understand the impacts of carbon dioxide on plants. It is now owned and run by the University of Arizona . And today, scientists there are quietly plugging away at research they hope will help people adapt to human-caused climate change on Biosphere 1 — that is, Earth. Myriad scientific papers, progress and lessons have come from Biosphere 2. But it's not an exact copy of our planet's complicated biomes. ""No matter how smart we think we are, you're never going to re-create Earth in its entirety,"" Adams said. Here's a look at some of the experiments that Biosphere 2's scientists have dreamt up and are tinkering with in this big glass building in the desert. Cacao and coffee trees among other species grow in the rainforest at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz., U.S. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption Ants climb on a cacao pod on one of the trees in the rainforest at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz., U.S. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption Cacao and coffee trees among other species grow in the rainforest at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz., U.S. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption Inside Biosphere 2's giant glass pyramid, tropical trees stretch 80 feet above the forest floor. Crazy ants, so named because of their erratic movements, scurry below. The rainforest is less diverse now than it was when Biosphere 2 first started its experiments, said rainforest research specialist Jason de Leeuw. There aren't many animals beyond the ants and a few other creepy-crawlies. But some original hibiscus trees, pterocarpus trees and even a small coffee tree still stand. These days, scientists are using the ecosystem, which includes an indoor waterfall and floodable stream, to measure the heat tolerance of cacao and coffee trees. The higher into the canopy you go, the hotter it gets, topping out at around 130 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.

""It's really one of the most heavily instrumented rainforests in the world,"" said de Leeuw. Scientists can even measure the minute daily expansion and contraction of the trees. Justin Beslity, a post-doctoral student who has designed low-cost plant monitors for Biosphere 2, hopes his work can help coffee and cacao farmers throughout the world closely monitor their crops. ""So that people could understand how their trees are growing and whether they need to be increasing new irrigation or there's something else wrong with it, because coffee is a cash crop for a lot of people,"" Beslity said. Their trees have produced some pods, and the scientists love the idea of starting up a coffee lab to show the process from tree to cup. They may even start selling Biosphere brew and chocolate, Beslity and de Leeuw said. Koi fish swim to the surface in the rainforest at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption Biosphere 2's fog desert is the landscape that hews closest to what lies right outside the building. It houses agave plants, cacti and other desert plants. Currently, there isn't much experimentation happening in that desert — but that's about to change. In early October, Biosphere 2 will receive endangered Quitobaquito pupfish to introduce into its habitat. The fish hail from Arizona's Quitobaquito Springs by the U.S.-Mexico border, where water levels dropped after the Trump administration began building a section of the border wall nearby in 2020, environmental news outlet Grist reports. Environmentalists had warned that construction could disrupt the habitat, though it's unclear if that was the direct cause, according to Grist. A new stream with ponds and waterfalls flowing down the desert's midsection will house the creatures in a kind of ""fish bank,"" where wildlife managers can withdraw them to repopulate the fish's native habitats. And the scientists plan to do research with the pupfish as well, de Leeuw said. Guests explore in the fog desert at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption ""We're interested in seeing if we put them in the different little ponds. Is there a genetic drift? Is there a change in their genes or things like that?"" said de Leeuw. The fish will also serve as scaly ambassadors for Biosphere 2's many visitors (more than 3 million since 1991, according to the organization), who will weave through the desert landscape. Lia Crocker looks at coral samples in the ocean ecosystem at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption Biosphere 2's ocean ecosystem contains 700,000 gallons of sea water brought in from the California coast — more than an typical Olympic-size swimming pool. Scientists suit up in scuba gear to explore its depths — up to 25 feet — and  row boats across its surface. Below is an artificial reef made of rock, where fish, sea urchins, plankton and alga all live. The water is jostled by giant machines to mix the seawater. Above it all hangs a big metal apparatus with lights that encourage coral growth in preparation for an upcoming experiment. The miniature ocean at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption The  mini ocean had coral when Biosphere 2 was  built, but no longer does. In order to reintroduce it, Biosphere 2 has partnered with Coral Reef Arks , an organization that creates geodesic domes. They're made from PVC pipes suspended from the ocean floor and serve as platforms for the coral to attach to. The design allows the coral to float above degraded ecosystems, giving it a better chance of survival and the ability to repopulate degraded reefs, according to Coral Reef Arks and Biosphere 2 research specialist Lia Crocker. Coral samples in the ocean ecosystem at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption She and the other scientists are trying to figure out the best geodesic dome designs and coral types to help repopulate bleached reefs. ""So the plan is to get the corals in here, have them hang out for a few months just to get a baseline of how they are in here and then ramp up the temperature over a few months,"" said Crocker. It's far from the most impressive-looking ecosystem housed in Biosphere 2. But the Landscape Evolution Observatory, affectionately known as LEO, is brimming with interesting science. ""It looks simple at first glance,"" said Aaron Bugaj, the lead technologist at LEO. ""But in the last 10 years we've seen a complex and beautiful landscape emerge."" LEO is made up of three metal trays, each bigger than a tennis court, filled with crushed basalt rock. Up above is a water system that's rigged to rain down on the basalt, as little or as much as the scientists want. One of three greenhouse areas in the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO) at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption Moss, including funaria hydrometrica fruiting bodies, and cyanobacteria grow in soil in one of three greenhouse areas in the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO) at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption It was built in the space where the original Biospherians had farmed their food. The agriculture was cleared away about 15 years ago, after which 150 scientists came together to help decide what new experiment should go in its place, according to Bugaj. They settled on studying ground water movement to better understand how a watershed changes under different conditions, such as the presence of various plant species or microbes, Bugaj said. The basalt is a stand-in for both early Earth and soil that has been depleted by factors such as years of growing a single crop. ""What's exciting about LEO and all of our biomes is that not only can we kind of peer into the future and answer questions about resilience ... we can also think about that idea of adaptation and can we develop novel methods that can increase adaptability in our ecosystems,"" he said. The ocean ecosystem at Biosphere 2 on June 20, 2025, in Oracle, Ariz. Caitlin O'Hara/for NPR hide caption There are many other scientific projects happening at Biosphere 2. Outside the facility, crops have been planted under solar panels — a practice called agrovoltaics, in which solar power and agriculture coexist and mutually benefit each other. The panels shield the plants from sun overexposure, and the plants help cool the panels. The facility is still examining how humans can potentially colonize other planets and has a radio telescope to communicate with satellites. And visitors still file through its doors, both for the sense of nostalgia and for the work it's doing today. John Adams, the COO, said people come just to take in the enormity of it all. ""There's no other facility like this in the world,"" he said."
20,Climate,"Dan Arthur, the president and chief engineer of ALL Consulting, stands beside a defunct oil well in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma on March 20, 2024. The well has not been used for years — there's no pump attached to it. But it hasn't been properly plugged, either. September Dawn Bottoms for NPR hide caption A knee-high pipe sticking out of the ground not far from a school. A gurgle in a pond on rolling farmland. A patch of forest undergrowth hiding a long-forgotten, leaking oil well. Relics like these dot the country from California to Pennsylvania: unused, unplugged oil and gas wells. They're called orphan wells. They should have been plugged when their useful life was over. But many weren't. These unplugged wells can leak oil, natural gas and toxins into waterways and air. Because natural gas, also known as methane, is a potent greenhouse gas, these wells are adding to climate change. And nobody knows how many are out there. This story is the second in a three-part series on aging oil wells. Click here to read or to listen to the first story, on why operators keep trying to squeeze a profit out of marginal oil wells. The third story, on the quest to finally plug abandoned wells, is coming up tomorrow. ""It is entirely possible that we have a million or more undocumented wells in the United States,"" says Mary Kang, an associate professor at McGill University who has extensively researched methane emissions from these old wells. This old problem is attracting new scrutiny, and a multibillion dollar effort to fix it . Step one: Figuring out where they are. Arthur, shown posing for a portrait in Tulsa, Okla., last year, consults for oil companies, and has worked for decades to address the problems caused by orphan oil wells. He also likes to look for them in his spare time, for fun. September Dawn Bottoms for NPR hide caption Last spring, Dan Arthur, a petroleum engineer and geologist, stepped carefully through Oklahoma prairie grasses to examine a capped pipe sticking out of the ground. An entourage followed: Arthur's stepson, an NPR reporter, a photographer, and one of Arthur's employees with an expensive camera that could detect gas leaks. Arthur's an oil guy. He loves the view of pumpjacks scattered over the prairie, the oil pumps that bob up and down across the horizon like strange, skinny birds pecking at the ground in slow motion. But to him, orphan wells are a serious problem — and they're a lot less visible than those pumpjacks. ""A lot of people don't see them,"" Arthur says with frustration. And if you don't see them, you don't even know there's a problem there to fix. Finding them is kind of like hunting for fossils, another hobby of Arthur's. ""Some people take their friends fishing,"" he said, standing in Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Osage County and gazing out on a stormy horizon. ""I'll go, 'Let's go hunt for dinosaurs.' You know, 'Let's go hunt for orphan wells.'"" More than 100,000 orphan wells have been documented , but everyone in the industry knows the problem is much bigger than that . Arthur and his stepsons have found wells in the middle of the Arkansas River in Tulsa, actively leaking pollutants into the river. They've found old wells in urban parks. Loading... Some orphan wells were drilled and abandoned in the early days of the oil industry, before modern techniques for plugging defunct wells were developed, let alone required. And that helps explain why they'd be missing from maps. Or, as Arthur put it, with exaggerated skepticism: ""You think all these early wells in Osage, when they were drilling, had permits?"" The history of oil development in Osage Nation is long and violent. A hundred years ago, as oil boomed, white people murdered many members of the tribe to steal their oil wealth — maybe you saw Killers of the Flower Moon. A few of the wells drilled during that bloody string of murders are still pumping today. Others are relics, left unplugged. This problem spans the nation. There were early oil booms in Appalachia, California and Texas, and they too left a legacy of unplugged, undocumented wells.

September Dawn Bottoms for NPR hide caption Most people don't look for these wells on spring break, like Arthur and his stepsons — but lots of groups are hunting for them. The Department of Energy is working with state regulators and tribal groups (including the Osage Nation), as well as academics and advocacy groups to map more orphan wells. That means looking at historical photos, applying machine learning to old oil records, attaching magnetometers to drones, using aerial photography, and, of course, going out into the field to look in person. ""We're finding more and more every single day,"" says Craig Walker, of the Department of Natural Resources for the Osage Nation. Not all orphan wells are old — and putting a pin in a map isn't always the end of the story. Take the waist-high, capped pipe that Arthur was examining, surrounded by pristine prairie and bison dung. Arthur said it could be an orphan well — ""We don't really know."" It definitely wasn't drilled a century ago. It was, in fact, drilled in recent memory. ""That was one of my favorites,"" says Shane Matson, the geologist and former oilman who drilled the now-idled well in the early 2010s. ""It was a spectacular, very fascinating well."" But, thanks in part to a market crash, the well was never profitable to run. Matson sold the well to a former business partner a decade ago. Then that partner sold it, too, Matson says. A pipe, left over from a now-defunct piece of oil equipment, stretches across the land in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma on March 20, 2024. September Dawn Bottoms for NPR hide caption So who's responsible for plugging the well? The Osage Nation's records indicate the well is potentially orphaned, and may be investigated to determine whether it should be formally categorized as such. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which administers the oil and gas leases in Osage County, maintains Matson's company is still responsible for plugging it. Matson says that company was bought by another, along with all of its assets, and doesn't even exist as its own entity any more. It's not an unusual situation. In many cases, responsibility for orphan wells gets passed along like a hot potato. That's because an unprofitable well is very expensive to close properly. It's much cheaper to put a small cap on top as a short-term solution. Such a well — capped, but not permanently plugged — can be sold from one company to another. That can end two ways: A company, usually under pressure from regulators, finally agrees to plug the well. Or it goes bankrupt and the well is orphaned. Now, plugging it is up to the government. And there's another wrinkle. Before actually plugging an orphan well, the Osage would also need to confirm that the well wouldn't be better off being reopened as a source of oil. ""If it's potentially economically viable for the Osage Nation, we cannot plug it,"" says Walker, of the Osage Department of Natural Resources. Daniel Caldwell, a technician for Arthur's company, ALL Consulting, looks through an optical gas imaging camera at an oil well in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma on March 20, 2024. September Dawn Bottoms for NPR hide caption There's an environmental cost to letting orphan wells linger. Natural gas — which is obviously found in gas wells, and often associated with oil deposits — is also known as methane. It's a fuel when it's in a pipeline and a pollutant when it leaks into the air. In fact, it's a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. On a hillside in Osage County, Arthur's employee Dan Caldwell sets up an optical gas imaging camera, an expensive machine that makes invisible gas leaks visible. The nearby wells look good. But they're connected to some old tanks. ""I think there's a plume,"" Caldwell says, and zooms in. Arthur steps over to take a look. The view through the camera is disorienting, a pixelated grayscale landscape. But there it is: a little stream of planet-warming gases, rising up into the air. Old oil and gas wells are not the top source of methane. Agriculture, landfills and active oil and gas production are all bigger offenders. And it's tricky to calculate the climate effects, because there's huge variation in how much wells leak; some release a lot of methane, others none at all. But it's not negligible. According to government estimates , old oil wells as a whole (including orphan wells) have a bigger climate footprint than all the motorcycles in the country. And orphan wells are a particularly odious source of the pollution because they provide no societal benefit at all. They are not a source of food or energy. They don't even make anybody money any more. Methane isn't the only risk; there are other chemicals like hydrogen sulfide that can work up from underground. ""These wells can impact people, the environment, groundwater, surface water, soils — all these different things over time,"" Dan Arthur says. Finding the perhaps one million existing orphan wells is a daunting enough challenge. But Adam Peltz, of the Environmental Defense Fund, says they are only half the problem. ""We have a million active wells that all eventually need to be plugged — and in the absence of policy change, a lot of them will become orphan too,"" he says. That's because right now, companies have an economic incentive to keep wells open as long as possible, even if they aren't being used. Wells at the end of their lifespan are often sold to other companies, whether small operators or big corporations , that specialize in older ""marginal"" or ""stripper"" wells . A tiny dribble of oil from those wells can still be profitable. Or owners might let wells lie dormant, arguing they might have economic potential in the future. But that increases the risks that some of these companies, particularly the smaller ones, will go bankrupt with unplugged wells on their books. Then they become the taxpayers' problem. There are rules — state, tribal, and federal — that are meant to prevent this from happening. But in many cases those rules have either been too weak or too easily skirted, and orphan wells continue to be created. And making the rules stricter would add costs for oil producers. The oil industry lobbies fiercely against such changes, arguing any state that adopts them would drive producers to friendlier regions, causing a blow to state coffers. The Bureau of Indian Affairs sums up the dilemma from an oil regulator's perspective: ""The regulation necessary to eliminate the possibility of orphan wells would be tantamount to a prohibition on development"" of Osage oil, the agency wrote to NPR last year. But many advocates are hopeful that states and the federal government could make real progress. Peltz starts rattling off things that could help: Government regulators could require companies to put up more money in the form of surety bonds that will help cover plugging costs if they go bankrupt. Or make it harder for companies to keep non-producing wells open for years at a time. Or collect more money from the oil industry as a whole to cover orphan well plugging costs, rather than relying on taxpayers to foot the bill. Many states, he says, are working on approaches like this, to hold the industry accountable for the cost of closing wells and avoid creating more orphans. He points to recent changes in Texas and Oklahoma as examples. ""There is no justification for orphaning wells,"" he says. Caldwell walks through dry grass in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma on March 20, 2024. A pumpjack is visible in the distance. September Dawn Bottoms for NPR hide caption A few years ago Mary Kang, of McGill University, tracked a 50% increase in how many wells had been documented in the U.S. over just six months. She attributes the increase to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which passed in 2021 and included $4.7 billion in funding for plugging those orphan wells — both creating an incentive for states to map them, and providing resources for the effort. Before using funds to plug wells, ""the states had to submit the numbers of orphan wells that they have in their state,"" she says. ""So that increase has a lot to do with states actually taking the time and effort … to document wells that they know of or improving their databases."" The well-plugging program was launched under the Biden administration. Some of that funding is currently frozen, but the Department of the Interior tells NPR via email that it is currently reviewing state applications for some grant funding and plans to open others after a policy review. In the meantime, more than a billion dollars have already been awarded. That federal money has already been transformative. But how far will $4.7 billion go toward actually plugging wells? ""Oh, it's not enough,"" Kang says, immediately. That's because once they're found, fixing them is pricey. They have to be examined, cleaned up and carefully filled with cement. ""I have spent as low as $20,000 and as high as $300,000,"" says Everett Waller, the former chair of the Osage Minerals Council. Before the current federal funding existed, Waller led an effort to plug orphan wells on the tribe's land. At the time, the tribe knew of about 1,600. With a budget of $19 million, Waller managed to plug just 85. That's a microcosm of the trend nationwide. Every attempt to plug orphan wells has been dwarfed by the size of the problem. But Waller, who says he's the only chairman of the Osage Minerals Council who saw more wells plugged than drilled on tribal lands, says that giving up is not an option. ""I don't want my children to have to live through things that I can fix,"" he says."
21,Climate,"The Earth's atmosphere and its oceans constantly affect one another; it's a feedback loop that influences wind and weather patterns, ocean currents, and more. But what happens when the atmosphere starts to warm? Teekay Merah/Getty Images hide caption The Earth's atmosphere and its oceans constantly affect one another; it's a feedback loop that influences wind and weather patterns, ocean currents, and more. But what happens when the atmosphere starts to warm? A warming climate doesn't just affect dry land — it affects the ocean, too. For many years, Earth's ocean has acted as a heat sink for climate change: A large part of the heat generated by human use of fossil fuels is being absorbed by the ocean. And while the deep sea is largely unaffected by this heat absorption, the upper ocean — the ~200 meters closest to the surface — is significantly affected. Based on a number of models, scientists predict that in a warming climate, the majority of surface currents across the globe will significantly accelerate. Some of them, like the Atlantic Circumpolar Current around Antarctica, are already shifting. That has the potential to cause huge knock-on effects, including sea level rise, changing fish migration cycles, shifting storm patterns and more.

23,Climate,"A resident of Altadena, Calif., during wildfires in January 2025. Wildfires are getting more extreme because of climate change. The Trump administration has taken down the website for the National Climate Assessment, which is the most comprehensive and authoritative source of information about how climate change is affecting all parts of the U.S. Ethan Swope/AP hide caption The website that hosts the most recent edition of the National Climate Assessment has gone dark . The sprawling report is the most influential source of information about how climate change affects the United States. The National Climate Assessment is widely used by teachers, city planners, farmers, judges and regular citizens looking for answers to common questions such as how quickly sea levels are rising near American cities and how to deal with wildfire smoke exposure. The most recent edition had a searchable atlas that allowed anyone to learn about the current and future effects of global warming in their specific town or state. On Monday, the government website that hosts all of that information stopped working. The Trump administration had already halted work on the next edition of the report, and fired all the staff who worked on it. The White House did not respond to questions about why the climate report website was taken down, or whether the administration plans to create the next edition of the climate assessment as Congress mandates. Congress requires the federal government to publish the National Climate Assessment every four years. The last edition was published in 2023, and underscored the degree to which climate change is expensive, deadly and preventable . ""If you are a human being in the United States, your life is already being impacted by climate change whether you know it or not,"" says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist who was one of the authors of the report. ""If we don't recognize that, it's simply because we haven't connected the dots. And the National Climate Assessment was one of the primary tools connecting those dots."" The next edition was supposed to be released in 2027, and about 400 volunteer authors had started working on it. That work stopped after all the federal staff who coordinate it were let go in April. You can still access the National Climate Assessment on other websites Although the original National Climate Assessment website is down, it's still possible to access the information. An archived version of the most recent edition is available through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . All five editions of the National Climate Assessment that have been published over the years will also be available on NASA's website, according to NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens. NASA doesn't yet know when that website will be available to the public. NOAA's archive site is not searchable the way the original website was. An archived version of the original, searchable website is available through the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine tool here . The interactive atlas portion of the National Climate Assessment, which allows users to zoom in on specific locations, is still available on a website hosted by the mapping software company Esri. The climate assessment used that company's map platform to publish the interactive atlas tool."
